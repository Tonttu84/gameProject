# Campaign Mode — Working Plan & Session Handoff

## Handoff — read this first (especially on a new machine)

**What this file is:** the living plan for the campaign-mode feature, plus the context a
fresh session needs to continue it. It exists in the repo so that moving to another
computer needs nothing but a normal `git clone` — no manual copying required.

**Where Claude's auto-memory normally lives (and why it's not here):** in a default setup my
per-project memory sits *outside* this repo, at
`~/.claude/projects/c--gameProject/memory/` (a `MEMORY.md` index + one file per fact) and
the interactive plan at `~/.claude/plans/whimsical-greeting-snail.md`. That folder name
(`c--gameProject`) is derived from the project's absolute path (`c:\gameProject`). So on a
new machine that memory is only auto-loaded if you (a) put the project at the *same path* and
(b) copy `~/.claude` over. **This committed file is the fallback that doesn't depend on any of
that** — if the auto-memory isn't present, treat this file + `CLAUDE.md` + `git log` as the
source of truth.

**To pick up the work cold:** read `CLAUDE.md` (build/test/architecture), then this file, then
`git log --oneline -15` to see which stages have actually landed. Don't trust the "done"
notes below over the git history if they ever disagree — the commits win.

### Project state (as of 2026-07-05)

- **Branch:** `feature/campaign-mode`. Turn length = **two weeks** (`DAYS_PER_TURN = 14`,
  final). Campaign schema version is **4** — bump `CAMPAIGN_SCHEMA_VERSION` on every
  incompatible campaign-model change (there is no back-compat; mismatched docs are deleted).
- **Merged to `main`:** Stages 0–1 (merge `5fbbb9d`), Stage 2 foraging + Docker stack
  (merge `b6d2a40`).
- **Done & committed on `feature/campaign-mode`:** Stage 5 augury rework (`77ee3ef`),
  deployment orders panel (`002fb73`), `make frontend-test` fix (`395bc34`), in-game bug
  reports (`71ac20f`), 2026-07-05 playtest fixes (placement roster filter, immediate
  battle-annihilation defeat, **augury v4** — see below), **renderer-layout unification
  (2026-07-06** — see the SHIPPED bullet below**)**.
- **First playtest happened 2026-07-05** (Docker stack on the Windows/Docker-Desktop
  machine) and drove a full day of fixes/features, ALL landed and deployed same day:
  - **Replay/SFML parity shipped**: `ReplayRecorder` emits per-unit `squad` (name),
    `side` (HexDirection 0–5) and `rank` when engaged (omitted otherwise);
    `ReplayView.jsx` renders one glyph per unit (5 Mages = MMMMM), colors by squad
    (SFML `SQUAD_PALETTE` mirror, name-hashed), lays engaged units along their hex side
    by rank, and has geometry tests (side direction, rank depth, squad coloring) — the
    React replay is the assertable window into engine formation behavior.
  - **Campaign squads**: `buildSquadsFromArmy` (UnitRegistry) groups same-hex same-type
    placement stacks into engine `Squad`s in `./game battle` — formation movement +
    SFML squad colors now apply to campaign battles.
  - **Full-deployment rule**: Fight requires the whole non-foraging army on the field
    (client gate + "N still in camp" counter + server-side 400).
  - **Build-stamp save wiping**: the Docker image stamps `/app/BUILD_VERSION` after all
    content COPYs (fresh on any changed build, no manual bump); campaigns record
    `buildVersion` and the listing route purges saves from other builds. Client
    recovers from the resulting mid-session 404s by reloading to the start screen.
  - **Battle window hold**: `BATTLE_HOLD_WINDOW=1` (set only by
    `docker-compose.display.yml`) keeps the SFML window open at battle end until the
    player closes it; result JSON prints after close. Headless/CI unchanged.
    In-window REWIND is still open — needs rendering from recorded ticks, not live
    `Battlefield` state; the web replay covers scrubbing meanwhile.
  - Open augury debug flag: `AUGURY_DEBUG_SHOW_TRUTH=true` shows truths at consult;
    flip to false for the final reroll-gated reveal. Duplicate visions across slots
    (two Traders) are possible and accepted for now.
  - **Renderer-layout unification SHIPPED (2026-07-06 session).** The 2026-07-05
    duplication flag is resolved: in-hex formation layout is one pure engine function,
    `layoutHexFormation()` (`backend/engine/src/FormationLayout.cpp`), returning
    normalized offsets (ox, oy, sz ∈ hex-radius units) per alive unit in draw order.
    `BattleRenderer` consumes it live; `ReplayRecorder` writes ox/oy/sz onto every
    unit of every tick (3-decimal rounding); `ReplayView.jsx` just draws
    `center + offset × HEX_SIZE` (web axes are transposed vs engine flat space:
    ox→web y, oy→web x) and its side/rank geometry is DELETED — side/rank stay in
    tick docs as queryable FACTS only. Parity is pinned by
    `test_formation_layout.cpp` (geometry contract) + a recorder test asserting
    recorded offsets == the function's output. **Gotcha found on the way: the
    campaign-server `Tick` unit schema is strict — new engine fields MUST be added
    to `models/tick.js` or Mongo silently strips them** (caught by driving the real
    stack; now pinned by a battles.test assertion). Layout decisions from this
    session's visual pass (user): battle-line ranks 1–3 all draw at the SAME size
    (no shrinking for standing in the second line; depth = position + SFML alpha);
    squad palette colors stay as the unit color override for visual debugging until
    sprites land (team reads from the hex tint), and SFML now hashes the squad NAME
    (same function as the web) so a squad wears one color in both views and across
    runs. Reminder while playtesting: every redeploy needs a hard browser refresh —
    a stale bundle is the usual "feature missing" culprit.
- **SFML retirement — Phase 1 SHIPPED (2026-07-07).** The browser `ReplayView` is now the
  ONLY renderer. Landed as four commits on `feature/campaign-mode`: (1) headless battle
  path (`runBattleFromJson`/`runBattleLoop`/`runSampleBattle`/`runSpreadTest`/`main.cpp` drop
  the `BattleRenderer`; the `BATTLE_HOLD_WINDOW` window-hold is gone); (2) browser replay made
  lossless — `ReplayRecorder` writes per-unit `broken`/`cast`, `tick.js` schema + fixtures
  gain them, `ReplayView` ports the SFML cues (casting yellow, broken orange with broken
  winning, `RANK_ALPHA {140,255,200,160}` dimming keyed on recorded `side`/`rank`); (3) SFML
  deleted — `backend/render/` gone, `Utility` font/`load()` and `HexGrid`'s render-only
  `hexToPixel`/`getHexSize`/`_origin`/`_hexSize` removed (the last SFML in the engine + test
  binary), Makefile/Dockerfile/CI/`docker-entrypoint.sh`/`docker-compose.display.yml`/
  `docker-up-display`/vendored font all stripped; (4) `sample`/`spread` run headless and each
  WRITES a replay JSON (same `{map,cols,rows,ticks}` shape as a campaign battle) to a path
  arg or default `replays/` (user steer: reuse the campaign's own replay format, take a file
  arg or default path). Verified in WSL: `make` links `game` with zero SFML (`ldd` clean),
  `make test-serial` green (308 cases), campaign-server + frontend vitest green.
  **GOTCHA for anyone touching the loop:** the plan's `while (field.tick()) record` sketch
  DROPS the final tick (which does a full turn's work before returning false) — the shipped
  loop records after EVERY `tick()` so a `max_turns=N` battle yields `N+1` ticks and stdout
  stays byte-compatible.
- **Phase 2 SHIPPED (2026-07-08): the sample battle rides the real battle pipeline.** Design
  steer (user): don't build a bespoke replay-file loader — the browser renderer requires the DB
  (that's the whole point of retiring SFML), so the sample must be *run and stored* like any
  battle, then rendered from the DB. So `./game sample` now prints the SAME
  `{winner, *_survivors, replay}` envelope as `./game battle` (shared tail `runAndEmitBattle` in
  `BattleServer.cpp`; the old `replays/*.json` file write is gone — `spread` keeps its file
  output). Campaign server: `engine.runSample()` + `battleRunner.runAndPersistSample()` (persist
  extracted into a shared `persistBattleResult` so battle/sample/skirmish share one DB path;
  demo battle is ownerless, `user: null`). New **unauth** `POST /api/sample-battle` runs +
  persists + returns the summary. Frontend: a **"Watch a battle"** button on the login screen
  (`launchSampleBattle`) → the existing `ReplayView(battleId)` autoplays it, fetching ticks from
  the DB via the public `/api/battles/:id/ticks` route — the one and only renderer. `ReplayView`
  gained two additive props (`autoPlay`, `backLabel`); nothing forked. No new Makefile rule (the
  `sample` mode already lives in `./game`). Tests: `campaign-server/tests/sampleBattle.test.js`
  (route + persist + ownerless + ticks fetchable + 502) and
  `frontend/src/__tests__/sampleBattleDemo.test.jsx` (button → ReplayView → getTicks). **Build
  status (verified 2026-07-08): campaign-server + frontend vitest green; C++ `make re` +
  `make test-serial` green (308 cases, 3653 assertions) via the new `scripts/dev.sh` wrapper —
  the WSL permission prompt is resolved. Phase 2 fully verified.**
- **Stage 3 SHIPPED (2026-07-08): materials sink + real fortifications.** Landed as four commits
  on `feature/campaign-mode` (engine seam → campaign-server → frontend → dev.sh fe-lint tooling):
  - **Engine seam** (`55a1f7a`): `HexSide.fortDurability` (placeholder — set/serialized/shown, NOT
    yet consumed; the [[todo-combat-score-per-hexside]] erosion step makes it live). `HexGrid`
    toJson/fromJson round-trips it (`fortified_sides` entries become `{dir,durability}` when
    durability≠0, else the plain string — existing maps byte-identical). File-static direction
    parsers promoted to public `hexDirName`/`hexDirFromName`/`isHexDirName`. New
    `applyFortifiedSides(json, grid)` in BattleServer applies an optional battle-input
    `fortified_sides [{q,r,dir,durability?}]` array after the map loads (default durability
    `DEFAULT_FORT_DURABILITY=100`); wired into `runBattleFromJson`. The combat penalty already
    existed — this only feeds the dynamic level in. 315 C++ cases green.
  - **Campaign-server** (`a70765c`): `fortificationLevel` (0–2) + `militiaBoughtToday` on the
    model, `CAMPAIGN_SCHEMA_VERSION` 6→7. `campaignConfig`: `FORTIFY_COST_BASE=50 × (level+1)`,
    `FORTIFICATION_MAX_LEVEL=2`, `FORTIFICATION_PRESETS` (tier-gated player-front SE/SW sides of
    row-7 hexes on sample_battle), militia costs. `services/fortification.js`
    (`fortifiedSidesFor`/`fortifyCost`/`atFortCap`). Battle route injects `fortified_sides` for the
    level; new `POST /:id/spend` (`fortify` cost/cap-gated + `militia` food+materials, per-turn
    capped). `materials` event effect + quarry/tool_rot events. View exposes
    `fortification {level,atCap,nextCost,sides}`. 134 JS tests green.
  - **Frontend** (`f8c8b52`): `CampPanel` (fortify + militia, gated on view cost/cap) in the war
    council; `api.spendCampaign` + `useCampaign` fortify/buyMilitia; HUD fort-level readout
    (materials now shown raw, a spend currency); `HexGrid` draws a rampart per walled side from
    `campaign.fortification.sides` (perpendicular-bisector geometry, robust to the axis swap) so
    the player deploys behind the wall. 122 frontend tests green; oxlint clean.
  - Also added a `dev.sh fe-lint` task + allow-rule (`afbe495`) so oxlint runs prompt-free.
- **Then (NEXT):** **combat-score-per-hexside** ([[todo-combat-score-per-hexside]]) — make
  `HexSide.combatScore` erode `fortDurability` mid-battle so the placeholder goes live (sits
  directly after Stage 3). Then **Stage 4 — scouting** (coverage → cavalry-superiority gauge).
- **Balance stays rough** until the full campaign loop exists (plausible numbers suffice
  while features land).

### Playtest 2026-07-13 — pending items (Docker-on-Windows stack)  ⏳ NOT STARTED

First campaign playtest on the new Docker-only Windows flow (`make serve` → auto `docker-up`;
Makefile OS shim + boot login banner landed on branch `chore/windows-docker-makefile`). Sample
battle runs + rewatches fine. Four items found, none started — recorded here so a context clear
loses nothing. **Immediate next session = item 1 (campaign squads); items 2–4 depend on or follow
it.** Precondition fact: the campaign has **no player-facing squad concept yet** — placement
stacks only group same-hex same-type into engine `Squad`s inside `./game battle`
(`buildSquadsFromArmy`, UnitRegistry); the orders UI shows per-unit-TYPE rows in a hex.

1. **Campaign squads — DO FIRST (2–4 depend on it).** Add a real squad concept to the campaign so
   units can be grouped, **and seed the default starting army with squads so they're testable**
   (starting roster = `STARTING_ROSTER` in `campaign-server/utils/campaignConfig.js`). Needs a
   `CAMPAIGN_SCHEMA_VERSION` bump. Touches model + campaignView + placement/orders UI. Scope the
   data model before building.
2. **Hold-order granularity** (depends on 1). Today each hex/"square" shows a hold order **per
   unit type** (screenshot: Soldier/Archer/Mage… each "Hold (turns) 0"). Desired: only a **squad**
   carries its own hold order; every non-squad unit in a square shares **one** hold order for the
   whole square — not one per type. Order UI = the deployment-orders panel
   (`frontend` placement orders; `deploymentOrders.test.jsx`).
3. **Militia UX polish — pure frontend (`components/CampPanel.jsx`).** The commit button + resource
   validation ALREADY exist (`militia-button`, `canBuyMilitia`), so this is polish, not new
   function: (a) clamp the numeric input to max-affordable `min(floor(food/2), floor(materials/1))`
   (it currently accepts `99999999`), and (b) add a `title` explaining *why* the button is disabled
   (mirror the fortify button's `title` pattern a few lines up). Keep the server-side cap as the
   real guard.
4. **Omen header vs shown flavor — decide + fix (`components/AuguryPanel.jsx`).** The severity label
   ("A gentle/troubling/dire omen") comes from `vision.severity`, which currently tracks the **true**
   omen, so it mismatches the shown (false) flavor: *Harsh Weather* shows "gentle" (its truth is
   Supply Cache); *Reinforcements* shows "troubling" (its truth is Desertion). **DECISION (user
   leaned a):** (a) label the SHOWN flavor — severity should come from the displayed omen, preserving
   the bluff; vs (b) keep header = true omen as a deliberate truth-tell. Root cause is server-side —
   check where `severity` is set in `campaign-server/services/augury.js` (+ the omen pool in
   `services/events.js`): fix is likely sourcing severity from the *displayed* event, or auditing
   each omen definition so its own severity matches its own flavor.

5. **(DEFERRED — after 1–4) Fortification playtest aid + workers-resource readout.**
   - **Fortification testing aid.** Buying fortifications already works (Stage 3: `CampPanel`
     fortify button → `POST /spend {action:'fortify'}`), but the starting roster is too poor to
     afford them (fort button sits greyed at "Raise to level 1 (50 materials)"). Give a way to
     actually exercise them so the walls can be bought and seen on the campaign map + in battle —
     bump starting `resources.materials` in `campaign-server/utils/campaignConfig.js`, and/or add a
     debug "grant resources" option.
   - **Workers-resource readout.** Show a resource as **total AND used**, formatted
     `(total − used) / total` (available-over-total, e.g. `8/12`). OPEN QUESTION before building:
     define "workers" — a genuinely new resource, or a readout over an existing pool (foragers
     assigned vs. roster, or militia)? Clarify the referent first.

### Working conventions (carry these to the new machine)

- **Build is Linux-only.** On Windows use **WSL (Ubuntu)** or Docker. One dev machine has WSL
  but no Docker; the other (2026-07-05 playtest machine) runs the stack via **Docker Desktop**
  (`make docker-up-display` puts SFML battle windows on the Windows desktop via WSLg; GNU make
  installed via `winget install ezwinports.make`).
- **Docker-Desktop machine specifics (learned 2026-07-06):** its WSL Ubuntu has g++/make and a
  working WSLg display (`DISPLAY=:0`), so engine build/tests AND windowed `./game battle` runs
  work directly in WSL — no Docker needed for engine work. `make test`'s `run_parallel.sh`
  fails there (`bash\r`: CRLF checkout); use `make test-serial`. WSL has **no native node** —
  `npm` falls through interop to **Windows node 25**, so frontend/campaign-server tests run
  from PowerShell with `NODE_OPTIONS=--no-experimental-webstorage`; first campaign-server run
  needs a one-off `MongoMemoryServer.create()` warm-up (mongod download outlives the 10s hook
  timeout), and the 2 `engine.integration` tests always fail natively (Windows node can't spawn
  the Linux `./game` ELF — they pass in WSL/Docker/CI).
- **Node 25 gotcha:** its built-in `localStorage` shadows jsdom's and breaks the frontend
  tests (`window.localStorage.clear is not a function`). Run them with
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--no-experimental-webstorage` (the pinned nvm node in `make frontend-test`
  doesn't need it).
- **Engine:** build/test via WSL. Use `make test` (parallel) locally; `make test-serial` is
  CI's job. `./game dump-units` prints the unit catalog (SSOT lives in the C++ constructors).
- **campaign-server / frontend:** Node via the pinned nvm (`v24.11.1`) or plain `npm` (node is
  also at `/usr/bin`, v22). `make frontend-test` now uses plain npm.
- **Workflow:** small batches — easy fixes + tests first, clear context, **one feature per
  fresh session**; propose a split when scope grows.
- **Hidden-info discipline:** every campaign response goes through `services/campaignView.js`;
  never `res.json()` a raw campaign document. Tests assert this.
- **New unit workflow:** stats in the C++ ctor + one `UnitCatalog` line + a tripwire test;
  C++ is the single source of truth, nothing hand-maintained in JS.

# Rendering: retire SFML — the browser becomes the single battle renderer

**Decision (2026-07-07, user):** delete the SFML renderer; the browser `ReplayView` is the
only renderer. Re-adding SFML later is easy given the single source of truth — recover the
code from git: `backend/render/` and the SFML plumbing exist through commit **`5e8fb21`**, so
`git checkout 5e8fb21 -- backend/render` (and cherry-pick the Makefile/Utility bits) revives it.
No attic copy is kept — git history is the archive.

**Why.** The battle sim never needs SFML: `./game battle` just loops `field.tick()`, records
ticks, prints JSON — SFML was only the live window. Battle data already round-trips
C++ → DB → browser, so rendering in C++ buys zero speed and creates the only surface where
real-time (SFML) and history (browser replay) can diverge. Unit *positions/sizes* already come
from one pure engine function (`layoutHexFormation`) that BOTH the recorder and the old
renderer called; the only real difference was cosmetic styling. NOTE: the "in-window rewind"
task that spawned this already exists — the browser `ReplayView` has scrub/play/step. Nothing
functional is lost; we only port the visual cues so the browser is lossless.

**Architecture as found (all confirmed by reading the code):**
- `./game battle` (subprocess from `POST /api/battle`) opens an SFML window and runs
  `runBattleLoop` (`SampleBattle.cpp`): each iteration `field.tick()` → `onTick` records a tick
  → `renderer.render(field.hexGrid)` draws LIVE `Battlefield`. At end, `BATTLE_HOLD_WINDOW=1`
  holds the window (`BattleServer.cpp` ~232-254). Prints `{result, replay:{ticks}}` on stdout.
- `ReplayRecorder` (`backend/server`) writes per unit per tick: `q,r,ox,oy,sz,hp,type,team`,
  `squad`, and when engaged `side,rank` — offsets from `layoutHexFormation`. It does NOT record
  `broken`/`cast`.
- `ReplayView.jsx` draws `center + (ox,oy)*HEX_SIZE` at size `sz`, squad/team color. Applies NO
  rank-alpha dimming and NO cast/broken color. Already has the scrub/play/step controls.
- SFML-only surface: `backend/render/` (BattleRenderer); `main.cpp` window + `Utility::load()`;
  `Utility::font` + `Utility::load()` — the ONLY thing pulling SFML headers into the engine +
  test binary; `runBattleLoop`/`runBattleFromJson` renderer params; Makefile SFML
  download/link/font + `-I$(SFML_DIR)`; Dockerfile xvfb + X11/GL/freetype libs; docker-
  entrypoint.sh Xvfb/DISPLAY; `docker-compose.display.yml` + Makefile `docker-up-display`.
- `sample`/`spread` (`SpreadTest`/`SampleBattle`) are SFML visual dev scenarios. `sample` is
  the user's visual combat-FEEL debugger — it MUST return to the browser in Phase 2.

## Phase 1 — kill SFML, browser is the only renderer  ✅ SHIPPED 2026-07-07

**Done** — see the "Phase 1 SHIPPED" bullet in Project state above for what landed and the
byte-compat gotcha. The original plan (kept below for reference) was followed, with two
deviations worth remembering: the tick-recording loop is a do-while (records the final tick,
unlike the `while (field.tick())` sketch), and `sample`/`spread` write their replay JSON to a
path arg / default `replays/` in the campaign's own replay shape (user steer) rather than an
unspecified file.

Delete SFML LAST so the tree keeps building throughout. Suggested commit series on
`feature/campaign-mode`:

1. **Headless battle path.**
   - `runBattleFromJson` (`BattleServer.cpp` ~133): drop the `BattleRenderer&` param; replace
     the `runBattleLoop(...)` call AND the `BATTLE_HOLD_WINDOW` hold loop with
     `recorder.recordTick(field); field.setMaxTicks(maxTicks); while (field.tick())
     recorder.recordTick(field);`. Output JSON must stay byte-identical.
   - `runBattleLoop` (`SampleBattle.cpp` ~20): reduce to a headless version (no renderer,
     window, pause, or sleep) — or inline into callers. Scenarios still call it.
   - `main.cpp`: remove `sf::RenderWindow`, `BattleRenderer`, `Utility::load()`; `battle`/
     `sample`/`spread` call headless entries.
2. **Browser replay = lossless** (before deleting SFML, so old styling is still reference-able).
   - `ReplayRecorder::recordTeam`: add `broken` (bool) + `cast` (int `getCast()`) per unit.
   - `campaign-server/models/tick.js`: add `broken`/`cast` to the unit sub-schema — the STRICT
     schema silently strips unknown fields (pinned by `battles.test`). Extend fixtures.
   - `ReplayView.jsx`: port SFML cues from `BattleRenderer::renderUnitsInHex` — rank-alpha
     `RANK_ALPHA[4]={140,255,200,160}` indexed by `rank` when `side` present (solid 255 when not
     engaged); `cast`→yellow; `broken`→orange (broken wins). Add vitest for styling.
3. **Delete SFML.**
   - Remove `backend/render/`; strip `sf::Font font` + `load()` + the SFML include from
     `Utility.hpp/.cpp` (decouples engine + tests from SFML entirely).
   - Makefile: drop SFML download/link/rpath, `-I$(SFML_DIR)`, font copy — from
     CFLAGS/CLANG_FLAGS/test flags and all prereqs.
   - Dockerfile: drop xvfb + X11/GL/freetype + SFML lib copy + font. `docker-entrypoint.sh`:
     drop Xvfb/DISPLAY. Delete `docker-compose.display.yml` + Makefile `docker-up-display`.
4. **sample/spread headless + docs.**
   - `sample`/`spread`: run the scenario headless and write its replay JSON to a file (e.g. a
     `replays/` dir); print a result summary to stderr. NO browser viewer yet — Phase 2 wires
     it. Disconnected but data-producing.
   - Update `CLAUDE.md` (build/test/docker: no SFML, battles headless), `ARCHITECTURE.md`, this
     file.

**Verify (WSL — Linux-only build):** `make && make test-serial` (engine builds with ZERO SFML);
`./game battle < in.json > out.json` byte-compatible result+replay; `cd campaign-server &&
npm test` (tick schema incl. broken/cast); frontend `npm test` (replay styling); then drive a
real turn and eyeball the browser replay dimming/colors. Reminders: `make test` CRLF-fails on
the WSL box — use `make test-serial`; frontend/campaign-server tests run from PowerShell with
`NODE_OPTIONS=--no-experimental-webstorage`.

## Phase 2 — reconnect the visual combat-feel debugger  ✅ SHIPPED 2026-07-08

**How it actually landed (differs from the original file-loader sketch below).** The key user
steer: the browser renderer *requires the DB* now (SFML is gone), so a standalone replay-JSON
loader would be a second, DB-less render path — exactly the divergence Phase 1 removed. Instead
the sample battle **rides the real battle pipeline**: run it like any battle, store it, render
it from the DB. Only the battle-data SOURCE differs (the C++ scenario vs stdin JSON).

- **Engine:** `./game sample` prints the same `{winner, *_survivors, replay}` envelope as
  `./game battle` via a shared `runAndEmitBattle(field, mapName, title, maxTicks)` tail in
  `backend/server/src/BattleServer.cpp` (both `runBattleFromJson` and `runSampleBattle` call it).
  Dropped the `replays/sample.json` file write; `spread` still writes files (multi-replay tool).
- **Campaign server:** `services/engine.js` `runSample()` = `runEngine('sample')`;
  `services/battleRunner.js` extracts `persistBattleResult(result, {input, userId})` shared by
  `runAndPersistBattle` and the new `runAndPersistSample()` (ownerless, `user: null`); new
  **unauthenticated** `POST /api/sample-battle` (`routes/sampleBattle.js`) runs + persists +
  returns the summary. The ticks come back through the existing public
  `GET /api/battles/:id/ticks`.
- **Frontend:** `api.launchSampleBattle()`; a "Watch a battle" button on the logged-out screen
  in `App.jsx` launches it and renders the existing `ReplayView(battleId)` with new additive
  props `autoPlay`/`backLabel`. No forked viewer, no makefile rule.
- **Tests:** `campaign-server/tests/sampleBattle.test.js`, `frontend/src/__tests__/sampleBattleDemo.test.jsx`.
- **Verified 2026-07-08:** C++ `make re` + `make test-serial` green (308 cases) via
  `scripts/dev.sh` (WSL permission prompt resolved); JS suites green. Phase 2 complete.

<details><summary>Original sketch (superseded)</summary>

`./game sample` → browser: add a dev path in the React app to load a scenario replay JSON into
`ReplayView` (file drop / dev route / `?replay=` param) so watching how combat "feels" uses the
SAME renderer as real battles. One feature per fresh session.

# Campaign Mode: Foraging, Materials, Scouting, Augury Rework

## Context

The campaign layer today is React state in `frontend/src/App.jsx` (day, food, augury %, roster) — nothing persisted, enemy army is a hardcoded engine default, and the "augury" just shows 3 shuffled cards whose clicked effect applies (no roll, no true/decoy logic, no reroll). Goal: simulate ancient-warfare shadowing — both armies foraging the area dry, forager clashes, scouting mattering, imperfect omens — with a roguelite feel. All work on a new branch `feature/campaign-mode`.

**Locked decisions (user):**
- Campaign state moves **server-side** (Mongo `Campaign` model + campaign-server routes); hidden info (true event, enemy army/placement) never leaves the server.
- Forage area = **distance rings** (near/mid/far) around the shared camp; near depletes first; clash chance rises with distance + contested pressure. No regrowth.
- Augury = prediction only. Two events drawn (true + decoy); exploding roll decides if the shown prediction is true. **One reroll replaces the true event itself** (fresh pair + fresh prediction roll); design for >1 rerolls later. True event applies at end-of-day regardless (unless rerolled away). Event base accuracy **bonuses** for now (severe events = lower bonus; maluses later). Mage bonus from roster; character bonus placeholder.
- Campaign unit values are **derived from combat stats**, not hand-set: implement `movementSpeed` for real in the engine, add **ballistic skill** (exported ranged accuracy). Scouting value ≈ f(speed, ballistic) — archers/skirmishers/fast units good; fast animals auto-flagged by low ballistic. Add a **LightCavalry** unit; heavy Cavalry's role is screening/protecting foragers.
- Building materials = one merged resource (wood/metal split later), sinks: fortification stub + militia purchase.
- Every new screen gets a short intro behind a React `tutorial` flag (content pass can lag; hook-point ships).

**Cross-cutting choices:**
- Exploding dice ported to JS (`campaign-server/utils/dice.js`), mirroring `Utility::throwDice()` exactly (value d6 + *separate* explosion d6, recursive). Injectable RNG queue for tests, like `pushDiceRoll`. Shared test vector pins JS to C++ semantics (queue `[4,6,3,2]` → 7).
- Hidden info gated by one serializer `campaignView(campaign)` — never raw Mongoose `toJSON`.
- Forager clashes: cheap abstract formula first; engine-backed skirmish battles later behind the same interface.
- Extract battle run/persist logic from `campaign-server/routes/battles.js:15-58` into `services/battleRunner.js` for reuse (existing route becomes thin wrapper; its tests must keep passing).

## Stage 0 — Engine: movement speed, ballistic skill, LightCavalry

Demoable via `./game dump-units` + battles where cavalry actually outruns infantry.

**Movement speed (real implementation):**
- `backend/engine/src/Battlefield.cpp` `moveTeam()` (~line 590): loop each unit's movement decision up to `getMovementSpeed()` times per tick, re-evaluating target/engagement/preferred-range between steps; stop early when engaged, holding, at preferred range, or move-cost debt (`setSpentMove`) kicks in. Squad pre-pass: squad moves at **min member speed**. Flee: broken units flee at full speed.
- Set per-unit speeds in ctors: Foot 1, Cavalry 2 (heavy), LightCavalry 3, Horse/Warhorse/Scorpion 2 (values tunable).
- Update engine tests that implicitly assume 1 hex/tick; add movement-speed tests (unit with speed 3 covers 3 hexes on open terrain, stops on engagement, respects terrain cost debt).

**Ballistic skill (attack-skill scale — 10 = average trained human, matching melee `attackPWR` ~11):**
- New `int ballisticSkill` on `AUnit` + getter, set in ctors on the melee-like baseline: Archer 10, Mage 12, Soldier/Pikeman ~4 (some throwing familiarity), LightCavalry 8, animals/undead 1–3. Clear baseline makes new troops easy to stat.
- The existing 0–100 `accuracy` field (`AUnit.hpp:304`) becomes **derived**: `accuracy = ballisticSkill × 5` (Archer 10→50, Mage 12→60 — today's combat behavior identical; hit roll ≤ accuracy on d100, aimed range = accuracy/10 = BS/2). Set it in the `AUnit`/`Human` ctor from BS so the ranged pipeline is untouched; the full accuracy rework is deferred and this derivation is the single seam to change.
- Export `stats.ballisticSkill` in `unitCatalogJson()` (`backend/engine/src/UnitCatalog.cpp:103-110`); tripwire asserts export == live getter.

**LightCavalry:**
- `backend/engine/include/units/LightCavalry.hpp` + `src/units/LightCavalry.cpp`: MountedUnit like `Cavalry` but light loadout (e.g. `MeleeWeapons::Shortsword`, no shield, LIGHT armour), speed 3, decent ballistic (javelin-flavored even if melee-only for now), unique symbol (verify unused; suggest `'l'`).
- `UnitCatalog.cpp` table: `{"LightCavalry", true, true, makeT<LightCavalry>}` + include.
- Tripwire `backend/engine/tests/test_unit_catalog.cpp`: expected-names list, placeable set, live-instance stat equality (now incl. `ballisticSkill` + real speeds), symbol lookup.

**Campaign-server mirror:**
- `campaign-server/models/unitType.js`: add `ballisticSkill` to `statsSchema` (strict mirror — sync aborts boot on drift, intended).
- `campaign-server/tests/fixtures/catalog.js`: extend fixtures.
- New `campaign-server/utils/capabilities.js` — derived campaign values from catalog stats (all constants in one place, tunable):
  - `scoutValue = speed * 3 + floor(ballisticSkill / 3)`  (BS on the 10-average scale)
  - `forageValue = speed * 2` (min 1 for Foot)
  - `screenValue = floor(armour / 2) + floor(attack / 6) + speed` (heavy cav high)

**Verify:** WSL `make && make test`; `./game dump-units` shows LightCavalry + ballisticSkill + speeds; `cd campaign-server && npm test`; frontend placement shows LightCavalry automatically (flows via `/api/info`).

---

## Stage 1 — Server-side campaign foundation

Moves the loop into Mongo + routes; ships with the existing simple pick-a-card augury ported verbatim (replaced in Stage 5) so the game stays playable. Enemy army becomes per-campaign server state (fixes the engine-ignored `enemy_preset`).

**Model `campaign-server/models/campaign.js`:**
```js
Campaign {
  user: ref User (indexed), status: 'active'|'won'|'lost',
  day: Number, battleFoughtToday: Boolean,
  resources: { food, materials },
  roster: Map<String,Number>,            // validated against unittypes
  auguryScore: Number,                   // legacy, dies in Stage 5
  events: { drawn: [{id,title,description,effect,isReal}], picked: Boolean }, // isReal NEVER serialized
  forage: {...},                         // Stage 2
  scouting: {...},                       // Stage 4
  enemy: {
    army: Map<String,Number>,            // HIDDEN; seed incl. LightCavalry
    supplies: Number,
    stance: 'camp'|'shadowing'|'offering_battle'|'withdrawing',
    plannedPlacement: [{unit_type,q,r}]|null,   // HIDDEN unless revealed (Stage 4)
  },
  character: { type: Mixed, default: null },    // placeholder; augury reads character?.auguryBonus ?? 0
  battles: [ref Battle], log: [{day, entries:[String]}],
}
```
Starting values in `campaign-server/utils/campaignConfig.js` (STARTING_ROSTER + `LightCavalry: 12`, food 100, enemy comp, upkeep divisor) — retires the `App.jsx:61` hardcode.

**Services:** `battleRunner.js` (extracted); `events.js` (EVENT_POOL moved from `App.jsx:11-20`; `enemy_advance` now sets `enemy.stance='offering_battle'`); `enemyAi.js` (supplies upkeep `ceil(size/10)`; stance machine: camp → shadowing after day 3 → offering_battle on low supplies or every 5th day → withdrawing = campaign won at <20% strength); `enemyPlacement.js` (random spread over enemy zone from cached `getInfo()`, axial conversion `q = col - floor(row/2)` as `App.jsx:126`); `dayResolution.js` — ordered pipeline, stages append steps:

1. forage (S2) → 2. clashes (S2) → 2.5 scouting accrual (S4) → 3. apply true event (S5; in S1 effect applies at pick time) → 4. enemyTurn (upkeep, stance, tomorrow's offer + forage plan) → 5. playerUpkeep (`food -= ceil(units/10)`; food 0 → 10% desertion, making `App.jsx:202` real) → 6. checkEnd → 7. newDay (draw events, regenerate plannedPlacement).

**Routes `campaign-server/routes/campaigns.js`** (all `userExtractor`, ownership → 404):
```
POST /api/campaigns                     → 201 campaignView
GET  /api/campaigns , /:id              → campaignView(s)
POST /api/campaigns/:id/events/pick     {eventId}   (Stage-1 stopgap)
POST /api/campaigns/:id/battles         {player_placement} → battle summary
     (server injects map + enemy_placement from plannedPlacement; survivors → roster / enemy.army)
POST /api/campaigns/:id/end-day         → dayReport {event, upkeep, enemy:{stance,battleOffer}, day, status}
```

**Frontend:** `api.js` gains campaign calls; new `hooks/useCampaign.js`; `App.jsx` keeps phase machine/auth/placements/replay + `tutorial` flag state, sheds day/food/augury/roster/events logic; "Start Campaign" screen; `components/TutorialIntro.jsx` shell (title + bullets, gated on flag, dismissal in localStorage). `CampaignHUD` reads campaign view.

**Tests:** frontend — extend `vi.mock('../services/api')` with a campaign fixture (auth/replay/placement tests keep assertions); add `campaignFlow.test.jsx`. Server — `tests/campaigns.test.js` using existing `helpers/db.js`/`auth.js`, engine mocked as in `battles.test.js`; **hidden-info test: no response ever contains `enemy.army`, `isReal`, or `plannedPlacement`**.

**Verify:** both `npm test`; curl smoke (login → create → pick → battle → end-day); two-day browser loop; Mongo doc has hidden fields, responses don't.

---

## Stage 2 — Foraging (rings + abstract clashes)

**Model:** `forage: { rings: [{ring, richness, initialRichness}] (300/500/800), assignment: Map<type,count>, enemyPlan: Number }`. No regrowth — depletion is the campaign clock.

**`services/forage.js`:**
- Player capacity `C = Σ assignment[type] × forageValue(type)` (from `utils/capabilities.js` — capability-driven, a future Flyer just works).
- Near-first allocation with spill; both sides allocate against start-of-day richness, subtract simultaneously, pro-rata on shortfall. Enemy plan computed by `enemyAi` from its own army, same formulas.
- Yield: `food += 0.8 × harvested`, `materials += 0.2 × harvested` (constants in `campaignConfig.js`).
- Clash per contested ring: `p = base[ring] (0.05/0.12/0.25) + 0.3 × min(P,E)/(P+E)`, cap 0.6.
- `services/skirmish.js` — `resolveClash(playerParty, enemyParty, ring) → {playerLosses, enemyLosses, yieldLostPct, log}`: strength = Σ count × (attack/4 + screenValue) + `throwDice()` per side (swingy on purpose); loser 2–6% detachment casualties (high-screen units die last), winner 1–2%, loser forfeits 50% of ring yield. Interface fixed so engine-backed skirmishes can swap in later.

**Route:** `POST /api/campaigns/:id/forage {assignment}` (≤ roster, before end-day). Assigned units are unavailable for today's battle — server subtracts assignment in the battle route's budget check; HexGrid gets roster-minus-assignment.

**Frontend:** `components/ForagePanel.jsx` (ring gauges, per-type steppers, projected yield/risk) + TutorialIntro; `CampaignHUD` depletion indicator. Tests: allocation/spill/contention as pure-function server tests with queued-RNG; `forageAssignment.test.jsx`.

**Verify:** deterministic math tests; curl assign → end-day → report; browser: ring 0 depletes over ~4 days, clash rate climbs.

---

## Stage 3 — Building materials (materials sink + real fortifications)  ✅ SHIPPED 2026-07-08

**Done** — see the "Stage 3 SHIPPED" bullet in Project state above for the four commits and what
landed at each layer. The design below was followed as written; the one nuance worth remembering is
that the map-file `fortified_sides` format was extended to accept either a plain dir-name string
(durability 0) or a `{dir, durability}` object, keeping existing map files byte-identical. Militia
buys `Soldier` for now (distinct `Militia` unit type still a later SSOT run). Next up is the
`fortDurability` erosion step ([[todo-combat-score-per-hexside]]) that makes the placeholder live.

**Militia = spear militia (user, 2026-07-08 — NOT scheduled yet).** When the distinct `Militia`
unit type lands (its own SSOT run, sequenced AFTER the combat-score/`fortDurability` erosion step —
do not build it before then), it should be **spear-armed** (a cheap levy: `MeleeWeapons::Spear`,
light/no armour, foot speed). Follow the standard new-unit workflow (C++ ctor + one `UnitCatalog`
line + tripwire test; campaign-server mirror). Until then `POST /spend {action:'militia'}` keeps
adding `Soldier` (`MILITIA_UNIT` in `campaignConfig.js` — flip it to `Militia` when the unit exists).

**Design decided 2026-07-08 (user):** fortifications are **abstract levels that fortify the
battle map at preset locations** — spending materials raises a campaign `fortificationLevel`,
which walls a wider span of the player's front deployment edge with engine `fortified` hexsides.
This turns the plan's old "combat effect = logged stub" into a **real** combat effect with
almost no engine work, because the engine already implements fortifications end-to-end.

**What already exists in the engine (confirmed by reading the code — do NOT rebuild it):**
- `HexSide.fortified` + `fortifiedDefender` (`hex/HexGrid.hpp`). `fortifiedDefender` is the hex
  whose occupants are protected; the attacker *crossing into* that side eats
  `FORTIFIED_ATK_PENALTY` (`Defines.hpp`, currently **1** — same magnitude as an elevation edge)
  in `AUnit::computeAttackBonus` (`AUnit.cpp` ~262).
- Fortified is **assaultable**: it only adds a combat penalty, it never blocks movement (only the
  separate `blocked` flag does — `Battlefield.cpp` ~96/135). So ramparts slow an assault, they
  never stalemate the battle. **Decision: ramparts only, no `blocked` walls** (user).
- Map JSON already round-trips `fortified_sides` per hex (`HexGrid.cpp` toJson ~322 / fromJson
  ~428). But campaign battles pass a fixed **map NAME** (`MAP_NAME`) and the engine loads
  `maps/<name>.json` from disk (`campaigns.js` ~205, `BattleServer.cpp` ~168-187) — the file is
  static, the level is dynamic, so the level can't be baked into the map file.

**Locked decisions (user, 2026-07-08):**
- Level scales **coverage, mostly** (wider walled span per level), engine penalty stays the flat
  constant for now. **Only levels 1–2** (cap `fortificationLevel` at **2**, not 3). A per-side
  strength bump ("a bit of both") is deferred — it arrives naturally with the degradation step:
- **Per-side durability placeholder (added this stage, user 2026-07-08):** the fortified hexside
  gains a **`fortDurability`** (int) "durability/strength" score. In THIS stage it is a *placeholder*
  — set at battle start, serialized, and shown, but **not yet consumed** (nothing erodes it). It
  exists now so the schema/data path is in place before the erosion logic lands.
- **Forward path (soon, not this stage — TODO: "combat score per hexside"):** per-hexside
  `combatScore` (the field already exists, documented in `HexGrid.hpp` ~60-68) will **erode**
  `fortDurability` as the enemy generates score against the side — an abstraction for pushing
  through / battering down the works; at 0 durability the side reverts to unfortified mid-battle.
  That step is what makes `fortDurability` live (and where per-level *strength* scaling — the "bit
  of both" — really bites). Safer still once maps are generated dynamically.

**The one engine seam (small):**
- Add `int fortDurability = 0;` to `HexSide` (`hex/HexGrid.hpp`), next to `fortified`/
  `fortifiedDefender`. Round-trip it in `HexGrid` toJson/fromJson alongside `fortified_sides`
  (so hand-authored map works can set it too). Placeholder — no combat/tick code reads it yet.
- `runBattleFromJson` (`BattleServer.cpp`): after `field.hexGrid.fromJson(mapContent)`, if the
  battle-input JSON has an optional `fortified_sides` array (entries `{q, r, dir, durability?}`),
  apply each to the grid — set `side->fortified = true; side->fortifiedDefender = <that {q,r}
  hex>; side->fortDurability = durability (default e.g. 100)` — mirroring the existing map-file
  `fortified_sides` loader (`HexGrid.cpp` ~428). ~20 lines + a round-trip test. This is the
  *whole* C++ change for now; the combat penalty is already there, the durability is inert. Keep
  the same `dir` string names (`NE/E/SE/SW/W/NW`) the map loader uses.

**Campaign server:**
- `models/campaign.js`: add `fortificationLevel` (Number, 0–2, default 0). Bump
  `CAMPAIGN_SCHEMA_VERSION`.
- `utils/campaignConfig.js`:
  - `FORTIFY_COST_BASE = 50` → fortify cost `FORTIFY_COST_BASE × (level+1)` (L0→1 costs 50, L1→2
    costs 100).
  - `FORTIFICATION_PRESETS` keyed by map name: an ordered, **tier-gated** list of player-front
    hexsides, `{ q, r, dir, tier, durability }` (tier 1 or 2). `fortificationLevel = N` activates
    every preset with `tier ≤ N`. Author these along the enemy-facing edge of the player deployment
    zone (`player_zone_rows` top edge of `maps/sample_battle.json`), `fortifiedDefender` = the
    player-side hex. Level 1 = a short center span; level 2 = a wider span, and its sides carry a
    higher `durability` (the "mostly coverage, a bit of strength" steer — durability is inert until
    the combat-score erosion step, so it's forward-looking data for now). `durability` flows into
    the battle input's `fortified_sides` entries. (Structured so it can migrate to a map-file
    `fort_presets` field later, but lives in config now — single fixed map.)
- New `services/fortification.js`: `fortifiedSidesFor(mapName, level)` → the `fortified_sides`
  array for the battle input (pure, from `FORTIFICATION_PRESETS`). Injected into the battle input
  at `campaigns.js` ~204 (`input.fortified_sides = fortifiedSidesFor(MAP_NAME, campaign.fortificationLevel)`).
- Spend route `POST /api/campaigns/:id/spend` (userExtractor, ownership → 404):
  - `{action:'fortify'}` → cost `FORTIFY_COST_BASE × (level+1)` materials; insufficient → 400;
    already at cap (2) → 400; else `materials -= cost`, `fortificationLevel++`, log entry.
  - `{action:'militia', count}` → 2 food + 1 material per Soldier, daily cap (distinct `Militia`
    unit type = later SSOT run). (Unchanged from the original plan.)
- `services/events.js`: add `materials`-type effects (quarry +25, tool rot −15).
- `services/campaignView.js`: expose `fortificationLevel` + derived `fortifyCost`/`atCap` (own
  info, not hidden). No enemy fortification info leaks.

**Frontend:**
- `CampaignHUD`: materials + fortification level readout.
- `components/CampPanel.jsx` + TutorialIntro: fortify button (shows cost, disabled when
  materials < cost or at cap); militia purchase.
- **Placement `HexGrid`:** draw the active `fortified_sides` on the player edge so the player can
  see the wall and knows to deploy behind it (positional — fortification only helps troops the
  enemy must assault across a walled side). Reuse `fortifiedSidesFor` output via the campaign view.

**Tests:**
- Server: spend validation (insufficient materials → 400; cap at 2 → 400; happy path debits +
  increments); `fortifiedSidesFor` returns the right sides per level (0 → [], 1 → tier-1 set, 2 →
  tier-1+2); the battle route injects `fortified_sides` matching the campaign's level; hidden-info
  test still passes (no enemy fort/army leak).
- Engine: C++ round-trip — a battle input with `fortified_sides` marks exactly those sides
  fortified (and a combat test asserting the attacker penalty applies across a fortified side).
- Frontend: `campPanel.test.jsx` (fortify button gating on cost/cap); placement renders the
  walled sides.

**Verify:** WSL `make && make test-serial` (round-trip + combat); `campaign-server npm test`;
`frontend npm test`; curl fortify twice (2nd at cap → 400) then fight a battle and confirm the
replay tick-0/side data shows the fortified sides; browser: fortify, deploy behind the wall, watch
the enemy assault eat the penalty.

## Stage 4 — Scouting (coverage → cavalry-superiority gauge)

> ### ⚠️ PENDING REVISION (2026-07-09, user) — NOT YET FINALIZED, do not implement
> The body of Stage 4 below is being **redesigned before it is built**. Recorded here so the
> reasoning survives a context clear; fold it *into* the Stage 4 body (rewriting, not just
> appending) after the current manual-testing pass. Design steer from the user this session:
>
> **Split the single gauge into TWO tied-but-distinct systems.** The Stage-4 body below collapses
> "scouting" and "cavalry superiority" into one band (Overwhelming → **Blind**). That's wrong:
> being *blind* is an information state, losing the cavalry contest is a field-control state, and
> **lack of cavalry must NOT mean blind** — especially in a fantasy setting (a scrying mage, a
> flyer, or a ranger sees without a single horse). Light cavalry feeds *both*, which is its
> identity; heavy cavalry feeds field control only; a flyer/mage feeds recon only. That divergence
> is exactly why the two are separable and worth separating.
>
> - **Cavalry Superiority = control of the open ground** (a *comparison* → band; fed by the mobile
>   combat arm, infantry ≈ 0). Governs foraging/security only:
>   - **Forage posture** — superiority → forage in small dispersed parties (cover more ground,
>     higher yield); inferiority → large escorted columns (less ground, must self-defend).
>   - **Supply-line tax** — weaker cavalry ⇒ more troops you must *detach to guard the supply line
>     / escort foragers*, i.e. fewer bodies in the battle line (legible cost, not just a multiplier).
>   - **Forager clash outcomes** — whether your foragers survive contact and whether you screen theirs.
> - **Scouting = information / reconnaissance** (fed by light cavalry **AND** fantasy recon —
>   scrying mage / flyer / ranger). Governs knowledge only:
>   - Locating isolated enemy troops; **raid timing** (hit them when their foragers are out);
>     forage intel (how many enemy units forage vs. camp).
>   - **Deployment reveal** — see terrain, and (more) see enemy troops before you commit placement.
>   - **Information initiative (tempo)** — the side with *less* scouting **commits its choices
>     first** (forage assignment, maybe deployment); the superior side reacts with knowledge.
>     Information = the right to move last. (Strongest idea: makes scouting matter even when nothing
>     is "revealed" on screen.)
> - **How they interlock:** light cav feeds both; the forage loop consumes both at different steps
>   (cav = how efficiently/safely you forage + supply tax; scouting = what you know + who reacts);
>   a **raid = scouting × cavalry** (scouting gives the opportunity, cavalry decides if it succeeds).
>
> **Divergences from the body below to resolve when rewriting:**
> 1. "Blind" is no longer the bottom cavalry band — cavalry bands mean *field control* (secure ↔
>    exposed); scouting gets its own scale.
> 2. **Reveal moves from automatic-by-band toward (partly) spendable.** User wants to "spend
>    scouting points to see terrain, more to see enemy troops." That reverses the body's explicit
>    "passive ratio, no point pool" decision — likely a **hybrid**: passive scouting *strength*
>    (comparison → drives the initiative mechanic + what you passively know) *accrues points* you
>    *spend* at deployment for reveals.
> 3. **Two derived unit values, not one** — a *mobile field-control value* (cavalry superiority) and
>    a *recon value* (scouting). Light cav high on both; heavy cav control-only; flyer/mage recon-only.
>    Engine `reconTag` still feeds the recon value.
> 4. **Event transforms (old Phase B) split by theme** — forage-raid/supply events key off cavalry
>    superiority; "you knew it was coming / night-raid warning" events key off scouting.
>
> **Open decisions still to settle (before rewriting the body):**
> - Scouting: pure comparison, or comparison + spendable points (hybrid)?
> - Supply-line tax: hard troop lock-out, or a yield/efficiency penalty?
> - Does cavalry superiority also gate the initiative/tempo mechanic, or is that scouting's alone?
> - Fantasy recon sources at launch — just light cav (+ "a flyer later"), or a mage/scrying
>   contribution from the start so "no cavalry ≠ blind" is demonstrable on the starting roster?

**Supersedes the earlier points/intel-tier draft.** Decisions this session: scouting is a
**passive coverage ratio**, not a spendable point pool; there is no intel "shop." The whole
stage hangs on **one derived number** — *control of the ground between the armies* — read as a
banded **cavalry-superiority gauge**. That single gauge drives everything: what you see, whether
recon-sensitive events land or get reversed, and how safely/efficiently you forage. It unifies
scouting and foraging instead of building two parallel systems.

**Design decisions locked (this session):**
- **Coverage ratio** for scoring (÷ own army size), **passive** (composition-driven, no UI
  friction, no assignment). Reveal is *consumed at deployment* — you see terrain + enemy forces
  when you go to deploy for battle.
- Big army must **not** auto-win scouting. Two independent mechanisms enforce it: the ÷size
  denominator (a blob dilutes its own coverage) **and** the relative comparison to the enemy
  (infantry contributes ≈0 to the mobile arm, so amassing it doesn't buy superiority).
- Scouting **transforms** recon-sensitive events, it is **not** a prerequisite gate — see the
  event-transform sub-section. (Event *prerequisites/chains* remain separate, later work.)

**Scoring (revises the Stage 0 `scoutValue`):**
- Per-unit `reconValue` goes **super-linear in mobility + a signed designer tag**:
  `reconValue = speed² + floor(ballisticSkill / 2) + reconTag` (rough, tunable). Line infantry
  ≈ small constant, light cavalry high, a future flyer highest (speed² dominates), a bare
  fast-but-blind animal net-negative via the tag. Squaring alone does **not** fix the size
  problem (300 infantry still out-*sum* 12 cavalry) — it only sets the marginal incentive; the
  normalization below is what kills it.
- New **engine stat `reconTag`** (signed; default 0; e.g. LightCavalry/hunter/ranger positive,
  Warhorse/heavy negative) on `AUnit`, exported in `unitCatalogJson()`, mirrored in
  `unitType.js` `statsSchema` + fixtures + tripwire — **same workflow as `ballisticSkill` in
  Stage 0** (C++ stays SSOT; nothing hand-maintained in JS). Keeps the new-unit workflow intact.
- **Coverage** (per side) `= Σ(count · reconValue) / Σ(count · size)` — "scouting per unit of
  army you must screen." Sanity numbers on the starting roster ≈ 0.39; drop the infantry and it
  jumps to ~0.82; *double* the infantry and it falls to ~0.35 (quality up, blob down).
- **Cavalry superiority** `= playerCoverage vs enemyCoverage` → bands
  **Overwhelming · Superior · Contested · Outmatched · Blind** (ratio thresholds in
  `campaignConfig.js`). Enemy coverage is computed from the hidden `enemy.army` — no new state.

**Model:** essentially **zero new schema for the gauge** — coverage and the band are *derived*
(from `roster` + `enemy.army`) in `campaignView` and `dayResolution`, the same way foodNeed and
forage capacity already are. No `scouting` subdoc, no `points`/`intelLevel`/`revealForDay`. (The
only later schema touch is enemy reinforcements — deferred below.)

**The one gauge drives three things:**

*Phase A — graduated enemy reveal (ship first).* `campaignView.enemy` exposes more by band, the
serializer staying the single leak gate: Blind → stance only (as today); Outmatched/Contested →
rough strength band ("a large host") + supplies trend; Superior → composition by category %;
Overwhelming → exact counts **and** `plannedPlacement` (the deployment preview already reserved
"HIDDEN until a scouting reveal"). Surfaced on the placement/deploy screen.

*Phase B — event transforms.* Recon-sensitive events (thematic only: ambush/raid/night-attack —
never plague/weather) carry a **3-rung ladder** keyed to the band: **Blind → full bad; Warned →
lesser bad; Anticipated → neutral or reversed to positive.** `dayResolution` step 3: if
`event.reconSensitive`, apply the rung the band selects; else apply the flat effect as today.
The **augur foretells the Blind rung** (the fate if you do nothing) — prophecy tells you what's
coming, scouting decides whether it lands (knowledge vs. agency). **Never invisible:** the day
report names the *fired* rung's own title + a "scouts intervened" flag, so the payoff is felt and
a mitigated threat is the same event downgraded, never a silent swap. Needs a couple of new
`applyEffect` arms for the positive rungs (`enemy_losses`, capture→free-reveal). Blueprints (not
a spec — clone these):
```
Enemy Ambush   Blind → enemy forces battle on their terms
               Warned → they advance, but you meet them in order (no surprise penalty)
               Anticipated → Counter-Ambush: you bait the trap, enemy takes casualties  (+)
Forage Raiders Blind → lose food/materials + forager casualties
               Warned → escorts intercept: losses cut sharply
               Anticipated → you destroy the raiding party: enemy loses the detachment  (+)
Night Raid     Blind → small food loss + a little desertion
               Warned → pickets catch them: negligible loss
               Anticipated → prisoners taken → free enemy reveal this turn  (+)
```

*Phase C — forage posture.* The band applies two **passive multipliers** to the existing forage
math: a **yield multiplier** (dispersed efficient sweeping vs. clumped defensive columns) and a
**clash-risk damper** in `forage.js`/`skirmish.js`. "Small groups vs. large escorted groups" is
the *fluff* for the numbers — the player doesn't micro group size. Preserves the tradeoff:
Outmatched you can *still* forage, just less of it. This gives **light cavalry a distinct
identity** (wins the field: recon + forage security) vs. heavy cavalry (battle shock). **Cleanup
to do here:** `forageValue` / `screenValue` / `reconValue` now overlap — consolidate toward one
"mobile-arm" value + one combat-screen value so cavalry's worth doesn't fragment across three
uncoordinated knobs.

**Deferred within scouting (own mini-stage, has a prerequisite):** *enemy reinforcement
detection* requires first **building an enemy reinforcement mechanic** (a schedule on `enemy` —
today the host only shrinks). Once that exists, the top superiority bands reveal *incoming*
reinforcements. Sequence after Phase A–C.

**Frontend:** `HexGrid.jsx` optional `enemyPlacements` prop → red unit symbols on enemy-zone
hexes (inverse conversion `col = q + floor(r/2)`) instead of the empty red tint, shown at the
top band; a **superiority gauge** readout (band label, no raw ratios — matches the "no odds in
UI" ethos) on the council/HUD; `DayReport` shows the fired event rung + scout-intervention badge;
TutorialIntros.

**Tests:** coverage math (blob lowers it, cavalry/fliers raise it, negative `reconTag` bites);
band thresholds; **the marquee hidden-info test — `campaignView` leaks graduated enemy info
*only* at the right band, and `plannedPlacement` only at Overwhelming**; event-rung selection by
band incl. the augur foretelling the Blind rung; forage multipliers; a coverage/band unit test
mirrored C++↔JS if any reconValue math is shared.

**Verify:** deterministic coverage/band tests; curl at three different rosters shows the reveal
tiers widen; **diff replay tick-0 enemy positions against the top-band placement reveal — must
match exactly**; browser loop watching an ambush get reversed as you swing superiority.

## Stage 5 — Augury rework (true + decoy, exploding roll, reroll)

Replaces the Stage-1 port; deletes `POST .../events/pick` and `auguryScore`.

**Model:**
```js
augury: {
  trueEvent: {id,title,description,severity,baseAccuracy,effect},   // HIDDEN until applied
  decoyEvent: {...},                                                 // HIDDEN
  prediction: { eventId, roll, threshold, accurate } | null,         // 'accurate' HIDDEN
  consulted: Boolean,
  rerollsRemaining: Number,   // config REROLLS_PER_DAY = 1; loop-safe for >1
}
```
Event pool gains `severity` (1–3) and `baseAccuracy` **bonus** (+0…+3; severe = lower bonus; maluses later per user).

**`services/augury.js`:**
- Draw at newDay: distinct trueEvent + decoyEvent.
- Consult: `roll = throwDice() + trueEvent.baseAccuracy + mageBonus + characterBonus`; `mageBonus = min(3, floor(sqrt(roster.Mage ?? 0)))`; `characterBonus = campaign.character?.auguryBonus ?? 0`. `accurate = roll >= 7`. Shown = trueEvent if accurate else uniform pick of the two. Response: predicted card + raw roll (exploding rolls are fun to show) — never `accurate`.
- Reroll: decrement `rerollsRemaining`; **redraw both events fresh (old true event will not fire)**; fresh prediction roll.
- Day resolution step 3 applies `trueEvent.effect` unconditionally; dayReport reveals `{predicted, actual, wasAccurate}` — the dramatic beat.

**Routes:** `POST /api/campaigns/:id/augury/consult`, `POST .../augury/reroll` (403 if none left / not consulted).

**Frontend:** `EventCards.jsx` → `components/AuguryPanel.jsx` (one prophecy card, roll flourish, "Reroll the bones (1)"); `DayReport` shows predicted vs actual; TutorialIntro ("the augur may lie; severe omens are hardest to read; a reroll changes fate itself"). Tests: queued-RNG determinism incl. explosion chain; reroll-replaces-truth (old true event id never applies); hidden-field discipline; `augury.test.jsx`.

**Verify:** curl consult/reroll/end-day; rigged RNG shows severe events mispredict more; full browser day with a lying augur.

> **Status note:** Stage 5 shipped early (commit `77ee3ef`, schema v3) ahead of Stages 3–4.
> The augur now foretells the Stage-4 "Blind rung" of recon-sensitive events (see Stage 4).

> **Superseded by augury v6 (2026-07-05 playtest; schema v4 → v5 → v6 in one session).**
> User redesign: each turn holds **three independent fate slots**, each a hidden
> `{trueEvent, falseEvent}` pair. Consulting reads each slot with the user's formula:
> `points = throwDice() (exploding d6) + AUGURY_BASE_POINTS (2) + mageBonus +
> character?.auguryBonus (placeholder 0) + trueEvent.baseAccuracy (legibility 0–3)`;
> `odds = clamp(points × 0.05, 0.05, 0.9)` rounded to whole percent. **The odds are SHOWN
> on the vision card** — the reroll minigame is judging a dire omen at 30% (probably
> noise) against one at 90% (near-certain doom) — and the vision is one d1000 `chanceRoll`
> against exactly that number (≤ odds×1000 → true event shown, else the false one). The
> 5% floor keeps a bungled reading worth something. **All three true events apply at
> end-of-turn**; the day-report reveal is per-slot (predicted card + odds vs actual).
> Clicking a shown vision rerolls **that slot only** (fresh pair, fresh reading,
> `POST .../augury/reroll {slot}`), spending the turn's single reroll (config
> `AUGURY_REROLLS_PER_DAY`). The old "UI never states odds" rule is deliberately
> reversed. `services/augury.js`, model subdoc (`augury.slots[]`, `odds` null until
> consulted), `campaignView` (`visions` array with `odds`), `AuguryPanel` (three
> clickable cards showing "% true"), `DayReport` (per-slot reveal) all reworked; tests
> pin the math at every layer (queue order per slot: throwDice chain, then the d1000
> vision roll).

## Deferred design backlog (user, 2026-07-05 — ideas only, NOT scheduled, no implementation)

**TODO — combat score per hexside (fortification erosion).** Make `HexSide.combatScore`
accumulate the net pressure the enemy exerts on a fortified side each combat phase, and have it
**erode `fortDurability`** (the placeholder added in Stage 3); at 0 the side reverts to
unfortified mid-battle — the abstraction for the enemy pushing through / battering down the works.
This is the step that makes `fortDurability` live and where per-level fortification *strength*
scaling really bites. Sits directly after Stage 3 fortifications; see the Stage 3 "Forward path"
note. (Mirrored as an auto-memory todo, but this repo entry is the SSOT — it travels between
machines; the memory pointer may not.)

**Morale overhaul (battle↔campaign).** Two morale tracks per army on a 1–1000 scale: a
**starting/max** value and a **current** value. Unit deaths damage the max a little and the
current more, so armies grind down over a campaign even between battles. If both armies are
still in decent shape when the battle turn limit hits, offer a **"fight another day"** option:
the battle ends, max resets — but takes a penalty for having been fought. (Note when designing:
the engine already has squad-level morale *states* — Confident/Normal/Scared/Broken with
casualty-triggered tests — this layers a persistent numeric army-level track on top; decide the
interaction, don't duplicate.)

**Battle events as cards (orders/leadership interactivity).** Make in-battle orders/leadership
interactive via event cards drawn/played during a battle. Examples: troops out foraging are
absent at battle start but can *arrive mid-battle* from an event card; rally cards; stronger
cards gated on a leader being present. Ties into the character system; also a natural consumer
of the engine's mid-battle-reinforcement support (the replay recorder already handles units
appearing mid-battle).

**Units-as-data restructure (user design 2026-07-05, planned in `docs/UNITS_AS_DATA_PLAN.md`).**
Units become pure stat rows: all attacks delivered by the unit's weapon vector (melee
already works this way), spells from a requirement-gated roster (paths later), boolean
capability tags (flying) on AUnit, and finally a UnitSpec table replacing the subclass
zoo. Staged R0–R4 in that doc; first candidate for a post-playtest engine session.

**Restructuring candidates (assessed 2026-07-05; none scheduled — all post-playtest).**
1. *Split `Battlefield.cpp` by tick phase* — movement / engagements / combat into separate
   translation units with `Battlefield` staying the owner/coordinator. Mechanical and fully
   pinned by the engine suite + `make clang`; do it BEFORE the DESIGN.md frontage/formation
   system lands there, since that work will otherwise bloat one already-large file.
2. *Retire the `Utility::getBattlefield()` process-global* (pass `Battlefield&`/context
   explicitly; same for the RNG queue). This global is why tests shard across processes
   instead of threads and why a process can only ever host one battle. Sizeable, engine-wide —
   schedule it together with the engine-backed-skirmish follow-up, which is exactly the
   feature that wants many cheap in-process mini-battles.
3. *`capabilities.js` consolidation* (forage/screen/recon values → one mobile-arm + one
   combat-screen value) — already part of Stage 4 Phase C, no separate action.
Design steer as the roster grows: prefer stat/tag-driven unit variation (the `reconTag`
pattern) over new subclasses; the catalog+tripwire SSOT is the thing to preserve, not the
class count.

## Follow-ups (out of scope now)
Engine-backed skirmishes via `battleRunner` on a small map (`max_turns: 30`, watchable replays); tutorial content pass; **`Militia` unit (spear-armed levy — see the Stage 3 SHIPPED note; sequence
after the `fortDurability` erosion step, then flip `MILITIA_UNIT` to it)**; region map; wood/metal split; flying scout/forager unit; enemy harass duty; character system; **enemy reinforcement schedule + its scouting detection** (prerequisite for the Stage 4 "reinforcement detection" mini-stage); richer event system (prerequisites/chains — distinct from Stage 4's event *transforms*).

**Deferred test-infra cleanup:** extract the stationary-enemy dummy (`movementSpeed = 0`) into one shared test header/cpp under `backend/engine/tests/` and migrate the current copies onto it — `ImmobileDummy` now lives independently in both `test_movement.cpp` and `test_battle_length.cpp`, and `test_main.cpp` has a near-identical `HighArmorDummy`. Convention: tests that need the enemy to sit tight use this dummy rather than holding a real unit.

**Deferred — frontend rendering/integration test coverage (user, 2026-07-07).** Now that rendering lives entirely in the browser (SFML retired), revisit test coverage with the JS test libraries already in place: broaden `ReplayView`/`HexGrid` **rendering** tests (styling cues, layout, terrain) and add **integration** tests where plausible (e.g. a full campaign loop through the campaign-server routes, or a battle → recorded replay → `ReplayView` round-trip). Ideas only, not scheduled; fold into whichever session touches the relevant surface. Pairs naturally with Phase 2 (the scenario-replay dev route is itself a testable render path).

## Independent assessment: weapons in C++ vs DB
**Keep weapons as C++ `constexpr` source of truth — do not move to DB.** Unit ctors reference weapons by identity (`addWeapon(MeleeWeapons::Pike)`); the engine is a self-contained stdin/stdout subprocess, and the DB is *populated from* the engine — a DB-sourced weapon table would invert that into a cycle and complicate the trust boundary. SSOT is about direction, not location: nothing downstream duplicates weapon data today, so there is no drift risk. Worthwhile later & cheap: extend `dump-units` to export each unit's weapon list read off a live instance (name, reach, shield, pen) for UI tooltips, optionally a `weaponCatalog()` + tripwire mirroring the unit pattern, synced to a display-only collection. No engine behaviour change.

## Verification (overall)
Per stage as listed. Cross-stage: WSL `make test` (engine tripwire + movement tests), `campaign-server npm test`, `frontend npm test`, then a full manual campaign: create → forage → scout reveal → battle → end-day with lying augur → materials spend → repeat until a ring runs dry.
