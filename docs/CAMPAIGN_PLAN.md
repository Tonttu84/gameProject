# Campaign Mode — Working Plan & Session Handoff

## Handoff — read this first (especially on a new machine)

**What this file is:** the living plan for the campaign-mode feature, plus the context a
fresh session needs to continue it. It exists in the repo so that moving to another
computer needs nothing but a normal `git clone` — no manual copying required.

**Where Claude's auto-memory normally lives (and why it's not here):** in a default setup my
per-project memory sits *outside* this repo, at
`~/.claude/projects/c--gameProject/memory/` (a `MEMORY.md` index + one file per fact) and
the interactive plan at `~/.claude/plans/whimsical-greeting-snail.md`. That folder name
(`c--gameProject`) is derived from the project's absolute path (`c:\gameProject`). So on a
new machine that memory is only auto-loaded if you (a) put the project at the *same path* and
(b) copy `~/.claude` over. **This committed file is the fallback that doesn't depend on any of
that** — if the auto-memory isn't present, treat this file + `CLAUDE.md` + `git log` as the
source of truth.

**To pick up the work cold:** read `CLAUDE.md` (build/test/architecture), then this file, then
`git log --oneline -15` to see which stages have actually landed. Don't trust the "done"
notes below over the git history if they ever disagree — the commits win.

### Project state (as of 2026-07-05)

- **Branch:** `feature/campaign-mode`. Turn length = **two weeks** (`DAYS_PER_TURN = 14`,
  final). Campaign schema version is **4** — bump `CAMPAIGN_SCHEMA_VERSION` on every
  incompatible campaign-model change (there is no back-compat; mismatched docs are deleted).
- **Merged to `main`:** Stages 0–1 (merge `5fbbb9d`), Stage 2 foraging + Docker stack
  (merge `b6d2a40`).
- **Done & committed on `feature/campaign-mode`:** Stage 5 augury rework (`77ee3ef`),
  deployment orders panel (`002fb73`), `make frontend-test` fix (`395bc34`), in-game bug
  reports (`71ac20f`), 2026-07-05 playtest fixes (placement roster filter, immediate
  battle-annihilation defeat, **augury v4** — see below), **renderer-layout unification
  (2026-07-06** — see the SHIPPED bullet below**)**.
- **First playtest happened 2026-07-05** (Docker stack on the Windows/Docker-Desktop
  machine) and drove a full day of fixes/features, ALL landed and deployed same day:
  - **Replay/SFML parity shipped**: `ReplayRecorder` emits per-unit `squad` (name),
    `side` (HexDirection 0–5) and `rank` when engaged (omitted otherwise);
    `ReplayView.jsx` renders one glyph per unit (5 Mages = MMMMM), colors by squad
    (SFML `SQUAD_PALETTE` mirror, name-hashed), lays engaged units along their hex side
    by rank, and has geometry tests (side direction, rank depth, squad coloring) — the
    React replay is the assertable window into engine formation behavior.
  - **Campaign squads**: `buildSquadsFromArmy` (UnitRegistry) groups same-hex same-type
    placement stacks into engine `Squad`s in `./game battle` — formation movement +
    SFML squad colors now apply to campaign battles.
  - **Full-deployment rule**: Fight requires the whole non-foraging army on the field
    (client gate + "N still in camp" counter + server-side 400).
  - **Build-stamp save wiping**: the Docker image stamps `/app/BUILD_VERSION` after all
    content COPYs (fresh on any changed build, no manual bump); campaigns record
    `buildVersion` and the listing route purges saves from other builds. Client
    recovers from the resulting mid-session 404s by reloading to the start screen.
  - **Battle window hold**: `BATTLE_HOLD_WINDOW=1` (set only by
    `docker-compose.display.yml`) keeps the SFML window open at battle end until the
    player closes it; result JSON prints after close. Headless/CI unchanged.
    In-window REWIND is still open — needs rendering from recorded ticks, not live
    `Battlefield` state; the web replay covers scrubbing meanwhile.
  - Open augury debug flag: `AUGURY_DEBUG_SHOW_TRUTH=true` shows truths at consult;
    flip to false for the final reroll-gated reveal. Duplicate visions across slots
    (two Traders) are possible and accepted for now.
  - **Renderer-layout unification SHIPPED (2026-07-06 session).** The 2026-07-05
    duplication flag is resolved: in-hex formation layout is one pure engine function,
    `layoutHexFormation()` (`backend/engine/src/FormationLayout.cpp`), returning
    normalized offsets (ox, oy, sz ∈ hex-radius units) per alive unit in draw order.
    `BattleRenderer` consumes it live; `ReplayRecorder` writes ox/oy/sz onto every
    unit of every tick (3-decimal rounding); `ReplayView.jsx` just draws
    `center + offset × HEX_SIZE` (web axes are transposed vs engine flat space:
    ox→web y, oy→web x) and its side/rank geometry is DELETED — side/rank stay in
    tick docs as queryable FACTS only. Parity is pinned by
    `test_formation_layout.cpp` (geometry contract) + a recorder test asserting
    recorded offsets == the function's output. **Gotcha found on the way: the
    campaign-server `Tick` unit schema is strict — new engine fields MUST be added
    to `models/tick.js` or Mongo silently strips them** (caught by driving the real
    stack; now pinned by a battles.test assertion). Layout decisions from this
    session's visual pass (user): battle-line ranks 1–3 all draw at the SAME size
    (no shrinking for standing in the second line; depth = position + SFML alpha);
    squad palette colors stay as the unit color override for visual debugging until
    sprites land (team reads from the hex tint), and SFML now hashes the squad NAME
    (same function as the web) so a squad wears one color in both views and across
    runs. Reminder while playtesting: every redeploy needs a hard browser refresh —
    a stale bundle is the usual "feature missing" culprit.
- **Next up after that:** **Stage 3 — materials** (spend routes: fortify `50×(level+1)`,
  militia; materials already accrue at 0.2 forage share), then **Stage 4 — scouting**
  (fully designed below — coverage → cavalry-superiority gauge).
- **Balance stays rough** until the full campaign loop exists (plausible numbers suffice
  while features land).

### Working conventions (carry these to the new machine)

- **Build is Linux-only.** On Windows use **WSL (Ubuntu)** or Docker. One dev machine has WSL
  but no Docker; the other (2026-07-05 playtest machine) runs the stack via **Docker Desktop**
  (`make docker-up-display` puts SFML battle windows on the Windows desktop via WSLg; GNU make
  installed via `winget install ezwinports.make`).
- **Docker-Desktop machine specifics (learned 2026-07-06):** its WSL Ubuntu has g++/make and a
  working WSLg display (`DISPLAY=:0`), so engine build/tests AND windowed `./game battle` runs
  work directly in WSL — no Docker needed for engine work. `make test`'s `run_parallel.sh`
  fails there (`bash\r`: CRLF checkout); use `make test-serial`. WSL has **no native node** —
  `npm` falls through interop to **Windows node 25**, so frontend/campaign-server tests run
  from PowerShell with `NODE_OPTIONS=--no-experimental-webstorage`; first campaign-server run
  needs a one-off `MongoMemoryServer.create()` warm-up (mongod download outlives the 10s hook
  timeout), and the 2 `engine.integration` tests always fail natively (Windows node can't spawn
  the Linux `./game` ELF — they pass in WSL/Docker/CI).
- **Node 25 gotcha:** its built-in `localStorage` shadows jsdom's and breaks the frontend
  tests (`window.localStorage.clear is not a function`). Run them with
  `NODE_OPTIONS=--no-experimental-webstorage` (the pinned nvm node in `make frontend-test`
  doesn't need it).
- **Engine:** build/test via WSL. Use `make test` (parallel) locally; `make test-serial` is
  CI's job. `./game dump-units` prints the unit catalog (SSOT lives in the C++ constructors).
- **campaign-server / frontend:** Node via the pinned nvm (`v24.11.1`) or plain `npm` (node is
  also at `/usr/bin`, v22). `make frontend-test` now uses plain npm.
- **Workflow:** small batches — easy fixes + tests first, clear context, **one feature per
  fresh session**; propose a split when scope grows.
- **Hidden-info discipline:** every campaign response goes through `services/campaignView.js`;
  never `res.json()` a raw campaign document. Tests assert this.
- **New unit workflow:** stats in the C++ ctor + one `UnitCatalog` line + a tripwire test;
  C++ is the single source of truth, nothing hand-maintained in JS.

# Campaign Mode: Foraging, Materials, Scouting, Augury Rework

## Context

The campaign layer today is React state in `frontend/src/App.jsx` (day, food, augury %, roster) — nothing persisted, enemy army is a hardcoded engine default, and the "augury" just shows 3 shuffled cards whose clicked effect applies (no roll, no true/decoy logic, no reroll). Goal: simulate ancient-warfare shadowing — both armies foraging the area dry, forager clashes, scouting mattering, imperfect omens — with a roguelite feel. All work on a new branch `feature/campaign-mode`.

**Locked decisions (user):**
- Campaign state moves **server-side** (Mongo `Campaign` model + campaign-server routes); hidden info (true event, enemy army/placement) never leaves the server.
- Forage area = **distance rings** (near/mid/far) around the shared camp; near depletes first; clash chance rises with distance + contested pressure. No regrowth.
- Augury = prediction only. Two events drawn (true + decoy); exploding roll decides if the shown prediction is true. **One reroll replaces the true event itself** (fresh pair + fresh prediction roll); design for >1 rerolls later. True event applies at end-of-day regardless (unless rerolled away). Event base accuracy **bonuses** for now (severe events = lower bonus; maluses later). Mage bonus from roster; character bonus placeholder.
- Campaign unit values are **derived from combat stats**, not hand-set: implement `movementSpeed` for real in the engine, add **ballistic skill** (exported ranged accuracy). Scouting value ≈ f(speed, ballistic) — archers/skirmishers/fast units good; fast animals auto-flagged by low ballistic. Add a **LightCavalry** unit; heavy Cavalry's role is screening/protecting foragers.
- Building materials = one merged resource (wood/metal split later), sinks: fortification stub + militia purchase.
- Every new screen gets a short intro behind a React `tutorial` flag (content pass can lag; hook-point ships).

**Cross-cutting choices:**
- Exploding dice ported to JS (`campaign-server/utils/dice.js`), mirroring `Utility::throwDice()` exactly (value d6 + *separate* explosion d6, recursive). Injectable RNG queue for tests, like `pushDiceRoll`. Shared test vector pins JS to C++ semantics (queue `[4,6,3,2]` → 7).
- Hidden info gated by one serializer `campaignView(campaign)` — never raw Mongoose `toJSON`.
- Forager clashes: cheap abstract formula first; engine-backed skirmish battles later behind the same interface.
- Extract battle run/persist logic from `campaign-server/routes/battles.js:15-58` into `services/battleRunner.js` for reuse (existing route becomes thin wrapper; its tests must keep passing).

---

## Stage 0 — Engine: movement speed, ballistic skill, LightCavalry

Demoable via `./game dump-units` + battles where cavalry actually outruns infantry.

**Movement speed (real implementation):**
- `backend/engine/src/Battlefield.cpp` `moveTeam()` (~line 590): loop each unit's movement decision up to `getMovementSpeed()` times per tick, re-evaluating target/engagement/preferred-range between steps; stop early when engaged, holding, at preferred range, or move-cost debt (`setSpentMove`) kicks in. Squad pre-pass: squad moves at **min member speed**. Flee: broken units flee at full speed.
- Set per-unit speeds in ctors: Foot 1, Cavalry 2 (heavy), LightCavalry 3, Horse/Warhorse/Scorpion 2 (values tunable).
- Update engine tests that implicitly assume 1 hex/tick; add movement-speed tests (unit with speed 3 covers 3 hexes on open terrain, stops on engagement, respects terrain cost debt).

**Ballistic skill (attack-skill scale — 10 = average trained human, matching melee `attackPWR` ~11):**
- New `int ballisticSkill` on `AUnit` + getter, set in ctors on the melee-like baseline: Archer 10, Mage 12, Soldier/Pikeman ~4 (some throwing familiarity), LightCavalry 8, animals/undead 1–3. Clear baseline makes new troops easy to stat.
- The existing 0–100 `accuracy` field (`AUnit.hpp:304`) becomes **derived**: `accuracy = ballisticSkill × 5` (Archer 10→50, Mage 12→60 — today's combat behavior identical; hit roll ≤ accuracy on d100, aimed range = accuracy/10 = BS/2). Set it in the `AUnit`/`Human` ctor from BS so the ranged pipeline is untouched; the full accuracy rework is deferred and this derivation is the single seam to change.
- Export `stats.ballisticSkill` in `unitCatalogJson()` (`backend/engine/src/UnitCatalog.cpp:103-110`); tripwire asserts export == live getter.

**LightCavalry:**
- `backend/engine/include/units/LightCavalry.hpp` + `src/units/LightCavalry.cpp`: MountedUnit like `Cavalry` but light loadout (e.g. `MeleeWeapons::Shortsword`, no shield, LIGHT armour), speed 3, decent ballistic (javelin-flavored even if melee-only for now), unique symbol (verify unused; suggest `'l'`).
- `UnitCatalog.cpp` table: `{"LightCavalry", true, true, makeT<LightCavalry>}` + include.
- Tripwire `backend/engine/tests/test_unit_catalog.cpp`: expected-names list, placeable set, live-instance stat equality (now incl. `ballisticSkill` + real speeds), symbol lookup.

**Campaign-server mirror:**
- `campaign-server/models/unitType.js`: add `ballisticSkill` to `statsSchema` (strict mirror — sync aborts boot on drift, intended).
- `campaign-server/tests/fixtures/catalog.js`: extend fixtures.
- New `campaign-server/utils/capabilities.js` — derived campaign values from catalog stats (all constants in one place, tunable):
  - `scoutValue = speed * 3 + floor(ballisticSkill / 3)`  (BS on the 10-average scale)
  - `forageValue = speed * 2` (min 1 for Foot)
  - `screenValue = floor(armour / 2) + floor(attack / 6) + speed` (heavy cav high)

**Verify:** WSL `make && make test`; `./game dump-units` shows LightCavalry + ballisticSkill + speeds; `cd campaign-server && npm test`; frontend placement shows LightCavalry automatically (flows via `/api/info`).

---

## Stage 1 — Server-side campaign foundation

Moves the loop into Mongo + routes; ships with the existing simple pick-a-card augury ported verbatim (replaced in Stage 5) so the game stays playable. Enemy army becomes per-campaign server state (fixes the engine-ignored `enemy_preset`).

**Model `campaign-server/models/campaign.js`:**
```js
Campaign {
  user: ref User (indexed), status: 'active'|'won'|'lost',
  day: Number, battleFoughtToday: Boolean,
  resources: { food, materials },
  roster: Map<String,Number>,            // validated against unittypes
  auguryScore: Number,                   // legacy, dies in Stage 5
  events: { drawn: [{id,title,description,effect,isReal}], picked: Boolean }, // isReal NEVER serialized
  forage: {...},                         // Stage 2
  scouting: {...},                       // Stage 4
  enemy: {
    army: Map<String,Number>,            // HIDDEN; seed incl. LightCavalry
    supplies: Number,
    stance: 'camp'|'shadowing'|'offering_battle'|'withdrawing',
    plannedPlacement: [{unit_type,q,r}]|null,   // HIDDEN unless revealed (Stage 4)
  },
  character: { type: Mixed, default: null },    // placeholder; augury reads character?.auguryBonus ?? 0
  battles: [ref Battle], log: [{day, entries:[String]}],
}
```
Starting values in `campaign-server/utils/campaignConfig.js` (STARTING_ROSTER + `LightCavalry: 12`, food 100, enemy comp, upkeep divisor) — retires the `App.jsx:61` hardcode.

**Services:** `battleRunner.js` (extracted); `events.js` (EVENT_POOL moved from `App.jsx:11-20`; `enemy_advance` now sets `enemy.stance='offering_battle'`); `enemyAi.js` (supplies upkeep `ceil(size/10)`; stance machine: camp → shadowing after day 3 → offering_battle on low supplies or every 5th day → withdrawing = campaign won at <20% strength); `enemyPlacement.js` (random spread over enemy zone from cached `getInfo()`, axial conversion `q = col - floor(row/2)` as `App.jsx:126`); `dayResolution.js` — ordered pipeline, stages append steps:

1. forage (S2) → 2. clashes (S2) → 2.5 scouting accrual (S4) → 3. apply true event (S5; in S1 effect applies at pick time) → 4. enemyTurn (upkeep, stance, tomorrow's offer + forage plan) → 5. playerUpkeep (`food -= ceil(units/10)`; food 0 → 10% desertion, making `App.jsx:202` real) → 6. checkEnd → 7. newDay (draw events, regenerate plannedPlacement).

**Routes `campaign-server/routes/campaigns.js`** (all `userExtractor`, ownership → 404):
```
POST /api/campaigns                     → 201 campaignView
GET  /api/campaigns , /:id              → campaignView(s)
POST /api/campaigns/:id/events/pick     {eventId}   (Stage-1 stopgap)
POST /api/campaigns/:id/battles         {player_placement} → battle summary
     (server injects map + enemy_placement from plannedPlacement; survivors → roster / enemy.army)
POST /api/campaigns/:id/end-day         → dayReport {event, upkeep, enemy:{stance,battleOffer}, day, status}
```

**Frontend:** `api.js` gains campaign calls; new `hooks/useCampaign.js`; `App.jsx` keeps phase machine/auth/placements/replay + `tutorial` flag state, sheds day/food/augury/roster/events logic; "Start Campaign" screen; `components/TutorialIntro.jsx` shell (title + bullets, gated on flag, dismissal in localStorage). `CampaignHUD` reads campaign view.

**Tests:** frontend — extend `vi.mock('../services/api')` with a campaign fixture (auth/replay/placement tests keep assertions); add `campaignFlow.test.jsx`. Server — `tests/campaigns.test.js` using existing `helpers/db.js`/`auth.js`, engine mocked as in `battles.test.js`; **hidden-info test: no response ever contains `enemy.army`, `isReal`, or `plannedPlacement`**.

**Verify:** both `npm test`; curl smoke (login → create → pick → battle → end-day); two-day browser loop; Mongo doc has hidden fields, responses don't.

---

## Stage 2 — Foraging (rings + abstract clashes)

**Model:** `forage: { rings: [{ring, richness, initialRichness}] (300/500/800), assignment: Map<type,count>, enemyPlan: Number }`. No regrowth — depletion is the campaign clock.

**`services/forage.js`:**
- Player capacity `C = Σ assignment[type] × forageValue(type)` (from `utils/capabilities.js` — capability-driven, a future Flyer just works).
- Near-first allocation with spill; both sides allocate against start-of-day richness, subtract simultaneously, pro-rata on shortfall. Enemy plan computed by `enemyAi` from its own army, same formulas.
- Yield: `food += 0.8 × harvested`, `materials += 0.2 × harvested` (constants in `campaignConfig.js`).
- Clash per contested ring: `p = base[ring] (0.05/0.12/0.25) + 0.3 × min(P,E)/(P+E)`, cap 0.6.
- `services/skirmish.js` — `resolveClash(playerParty, enemyParty, ring) → {playerLosses, enemyLosses, yieldLostPct, log}`: strength = Σ count × (attack/4 + screenValue) + `throwDice()` per side (swingy on purpose); loser 2–6% detachment casualties (high-screen units die last), winner 1–2%, loser forfeits 50% of ring yield. Interface fixed so engine-backed skirmishes can swap in later.

**Route:** `POST /api/campaigns/:id/forage {assignment}` (≤ roster, before end-day). Assigned units are unavailable for today's battle — server subtracts assignment in the battle route's budget check; HexGrid gets roster-minus-assignment.

**Frontend:** `components/ForagePanel.jsx` (ring gauges, per-type steppers, projected yield/risk) + TutorialIntro; `CampaignHUD` depletion indicator. Tests: allocation/spill/contention as pure-function server tests with queued-RNG; `forageAssignment.test.jsx`.

**Verify:** deterministic math tests; curl assign → end-day → report; browser: ring 0 depletes over ~4 days, clash rate climbs.

---

## Stage 3 — Building materials

- `resources.materials` already accrues from Stage 2; add `fortificationLevel` (0–3).
- `events.js`: add `materials`-type effects (quarry +25, tool rot −15).
- `POST /api/campaigns/:id/spend`: `{action:'fortify'}` → cost 50×(level+1), level++ (combat effect = logged stub); `{action:'militia', count}` → 2 food + 1 material per Soldier, daily cap (distinct Militia unit type = later SSOT run).
- Frontend: materials in HUD; `components/CampPanel.jsx` + TutorialIntro.
- **Verify:** spend validation (insufficient → 400) tests; curl both actions.

---

## Stage 4 — Scouting (coverage → cavalry-superiority gauge)

**Supersedes the earlier points/intel-tier draft.** Decisions this session: scouting is a
**passive coverage ratio**, not a spendable point pool; there is no intel "shop." The whole
stage hangs on **one derived number** — *control of the ground between the armies* — read as a
banded **cavalry-superiority gauge**. That single gauge drives everything: what you see, whether
recon-sensitive events land or get reversed, and how safely/efficiently you forage. It unifies
scouting and foraging instead of building two parallel systems.

**Design decisions locked (this session):**
- **Coverage ratio** for scoring (÷ own army size), **passive** (composition-driven, no UI
  friction, no assignment). Reveal is *consumed at deployment* — you see terrain + enemy forces
  when you go to deploy for battle.
- Big army must **not** auto-win scouting. Two independent mechanisms enforce it: the ÷size
  denominator (a blob dilutes its own coverage) **and** the relative comparison to the enemy
  (infantry contributes ≈0 to the mobile arm, so amassing it doesn't buy superiority).
- Scouting **transforms** recon-sensitive events, it is **not** a prerequisite gate — see the
  event-transform sub-section. (Event *prerequisites/chains* remain separate, later work.)

**Scoring (revises the Stage 0 `scoutValue`):**
- Per-unit `reconValue` goes **super-linear in mobility + a signed designer tag**:
  `reconValue = speed² + floor(ballisticSkill / 2) + reconTag` (rough, tunable). Line infantry
  ≈ small constant, light cavalry high, a future flyer highest (speed² dominates), a bare
  fast-but-blind animal net-negative via the tag. Squaring alone does **not** fix the size
  problem (300 infantry still out-*sum* 12 cavalry) — it only sets the marginal incentive; the
  normalization below is what kills it.
- New **engine stat `reconTag`** (signed; default 0; e.g. LightCavalry/hunter/ranger positive,
  Warhorse/heavy negative) on `AUnit`, exported in `unitCatalogJson()`, mirrored in
  `unitType.js` `statsSchema` + fixtures + tripwire — **same workflow as `ballisticSkill` in
  Stage 0** (C++ stays SSOT; nothing hand-maintained in JS). Keeps the new-unit workflow intact.
- **Coverage** (per side) `= Σ(count · reconValue) / Σ(count · size)` — "scouting per unit of
  army you must screen." Sanity numbers on the starting roster ≈ 0.39; drop the infantry and it
  jumps to ~0.82; *double* the infantry and it falls to ~0.35 (quality up, blob down).
- **Cavalry superiority** `= playerCoverage vs enemyCoverage` → bands
  **Overwhelming · Superior · Contested · Outmatched · Blind** (ratio thresholds in
  `campaignConfig.js`). Enemy coverage is computed from the hidden `enemy.army` — no new state.

**Model:** essentially **zero new schema for the gauge** — coverage and the band are *derived*
(from `roster` + `enemy.army`) in `campaignView` and `dayResolution`, the same way foodNeed and
forage capacity already are. No `scouting` subdoc, no `points`/`intelLevel`/`revealForDay`. (The
only later schema touch is enemy reinforcements — deferred below.)

**The one gauge drives three things:**

*Phase A — graduated enemy reveal (ship first).* `campaignView.enemy` exposes more by band, the
serializer staying the single leak gate: Blind → stance only (as today); Outmatched/Contested →
rough strength band ("a large host") + supplies trend; Superior → composition by category %;
Overwhelming → exact counts **and** `plannedPlacement` (the deployment preview already reserved
"HIDDEN until a scouting reveal"). Surfaced on the placement/deploy screen.

*Phase B — event transforms.* Recon-sensitive events (thematic only: ambush/raid/night-attack —
never plague/weather) carry a **3-rung ladder** keyed to the band: **Blind → full bad; Warned →
lesser bad; Anticipated → neutral or reversed to positive.** `dayResolution` step 3: if
`event.reconSensitive`, apply the rung the band selects; else apply the flat effect as today.
The **augur foretells the Blind rung** (the fate if you do nothing) — prophecy tells you what's
coming, scouting decides whether it lands (knowledge vs. agency). **Never invisible:** the day
report names the *fired* rung's own title + a "scouts intervened" flag, so the payoff is felt and
a mitigated threat is the same event downgraded, never a silent swap. Needs a couple of new
`applyEffect` arms for the positive rungs (`enemy_losses`, capture→free-reveal). Blueprints (not
a spec — clone these):
```
Enemy Ambush   Blind → enemy forces battle on their terms
               Warned → they advance, but you meet them in order (no surprise penalty)
               Anticipated → Counter-Ambush: you bait the trap, enemy takes casualties  (+)
Forage Raiders Blind → lose food/materials + forager casualties
               Warned → escorts intercept: losses cut sharply
               Anticipated → you destroy the raiding party: enemy loses the detachment  (+)
Night Raid     Blind → small food loss + a little desertion
               Warned → pickets catch them: negligible loss
               Anticipated → prisoners taken → free enemy reveal this turn  (+)
```

*Phase C — forage posture.* The band applies two **passive multipliers** to the existing forage
math: a **yield multiplier** (dispersed efficient sweeping vs. clumped defensive columns) and a
**clash-risk damper** in `forage.js`/`skirmish.js`. "Small groups vs. large escorted groups" is
the *fluff* for the numbers — the player doesn't micro group size. Preserves the tradeoff:
Outmatched you can *still* forage, just less of it. This gives **light cavalry a distinct
identity** (wins the field: recon + forage security) vs. heavy cavalry (battle shock). **Cleanup
to do here:** `forageValue` / `screenValue` / `reconValue` now overlap — consolidate toward one
"mobile-arm" value + one combat-screen value so cavalry's worth doesn't fragment across three
uncoordinated knobs.

**Deferred within scouting (own mini-stage, has a prerequisite):** *enemy reinforcement
detection* requires first **building an enemy reinforcement mechanic** (a schedule on `enemy` —
today the host only shrinks). Once that exists, the top superiority bands reveal *incoming*
reinforcements. Sequence after Phase A–C.

**Frontend:** `HexGrid.jsx` optional `enemyPlacements` prop → red unit symbols on enemy-zone
hexes (inverse conversion `col = q + floor(r/2)`) instead of the empty red tint, shown at the
top band; a **superiority gauge** readout (band label, no raw ratios — matches the "no odds in
UI" ethos) on the council/HUD; `DayReport` shows the fired event rung + scout-intervention badge;
TutorialIntros.

**Tests:** coverage math (blob lowers it, cavalry/fliers raise it, negative `reconTag` bites);
band thresholds; **the marquee hidden-info test — `campaignView` leaks graduated enemy info
*only* at the right band, and `plannedPlacement` only at Overwhelming**; event-rung selection by
band incl. the augur foretelling the Blind rung; forage multipliers; a coverage/band unit test
mirrored C++↔JS if any reconValue math is shared.

**Verify:** deterministic coverage/band tests; curl at three different rosters shows the reveal
tiers widen; **diff replay tick-0 enemy positions against the top-band placement reveal — must

## Stage 5 — Augury rework (true + decoy, exploding roll, reroll)

Replaces the Stage-1 port; deletes `POST .../events/pick` and `auguryScore`.

**Model:**
```js
augury: {
  trueEvent: {id,title,description,severity,baseAccuracy,effect},   // HIDDEN until applied
  decoyEvent: {...},                                                 // HIDDEN
  prediction: { eventId, roll, threshold, accurate } | null,         // 'accurate' HIDDEN
  consulted: Boolean,
  rerollsRemaining: Number,   // config REROLLS_PER_DAY = 1; loop-safe for >1
}
```
Event pool gains `severity` (1–3) and `baseAccuracy` **bonus** (+0…+3; severe = lower bonus; maluses later per user).

**`services/augury.js`:**
- Draw at newDay: distinct trueEvent + decoyEvent.
- Consult: `roll = throwDice() + trueEvent.baseAccuracy + mageBonus + characterBonus`; `mageBonus = min(3, floor(sqrt(roster.Mage ?? 0)))`; `characterBonus = campaign.character?.auguryBonus ?? 0`. `accurate = roll >= 7`. Shown = trueEvent if accurate else uniform pick of the two. Response: predicted card + raw roll (exploding rolls are fun to show) — never `accurate`.
- Reroll: decrement `rerollsRemaining`; **redraw both events fresh (old true event will not fire)**; fresh prediction roll.
- Day resolution step 3 applies `trueEvent.effect` unconditionally; dayReport reveals `{predicted, actual, wasAccurate}` — the dramatic beat.

**Routes:** `POST /api/campaigns/:id/augury/consult`, `POST .../augury/reroll` (403 if none left / not consulted).

**Frontend:** `EventCards.jsx` → `components/AuguryPanel.jsx` (one prophecy card, roll flourish, "Reroll the bones (1)"); `DayReport` shows predicted vs actual; TutorialIntro ("the augur may lie; severe omens are hardest to read; a reroll changes fate itself"). Tests: queued-RNG determinism incl. explosion chain; reroll-replaces-truth (old true event id never applies); hidden-field discipline; `augury.test.jsx`.

**Verify:** curl consult/reroll/end-day; rigged RNG shows severe events mispredict more; full browser day with a lying augur.

> **Status note:** Stage 5 shipped early (commit `77ee3ef`, schema v3) ahead of Stages 3–4.
> The augur now foretells the Stage-4 "Blind rung" of recon-sensitive events (see Stage 4).

> **Superseded by augury v6 (2026-07-05 playtest; schema v4 → v5 → v6 in one session).**
> User redesign: each turn holds **three independent fate slots**, each a hidden
> `{trueEvent, falseEvent}` pair. Consulting reads each slot with the user's formula:
> `points = throwDice() (exploding d6) + AUGURY_BASE_POINTS (2) + mageBonus +
> character?.auguryBonus (placeholder 0) + trueEvent.baseAccuracy (legibility 0–3)`;
> `odds = clamp(points × 0.05, 0.05, 0.9)` rounded to whole percent. **The odds are SHOWN
> on the vision card** — the reroll minigame is judging a dire omen at 30% (probably
> noise) against one at 90% (near-certain doom) — and the vision is one d1000 `chanceRoll`
> against exactly that number (≤ odds×1000 → true event shown, else the false one). The
> 5% floor keeps a bungled reading worth something. **All three true events apply at
> end-of-turn**; the day-report reveal is per-slot (predicted card + odds vs actual).
> Clicking a shown vision rerolls **that slot only** (fresh pair, fresh reading,
> `POST .../augury/reroll {slot}`), spending the turn's single reroll (config
> `AUGURY_REROLLS_PER_DAY`). The old "UI never states odds" rule is deliberately
> reversed. `services/augury.js`, model subdoc (`augury.slots[]`, `odds` null until
> consulted), `campaignView` (`visions` array with `odds`), `AuguryPanel` (three
> clickable cards showing "% true"), `DayReport` (per-slot reveal) all reworked; tests
> pin the math at every layer (queue order per slot: throwDice chain, then the d1000
> vision roll).

## Deferred design backlog (user, 2026-07-05 — ideas only, NOT scheduled, no implementation)

**Morale overhaul (battle↔campaign).** Two morale tracks per army on a 1–1000 scale: a
**starting/max** value and a **current** value. Unit deaths damage the max a little and the
current more, so armies grind down over a campaign even between battles. If both armies are
still in decent shape when the battle turn limit hits, offer a **"fight another day"** option:
the battle ends, max resets — but takes a penalty for having been fought. (Note when designing:
the engine already has squad-level morale *states* — Confident/Normal/Scared/Broken with
casualty-triggered tests — this layers a persistent numeric army-level track on top; decide the
interaction, don't duplicate.)

**Battle events as cards (orders/leadership interactivity).** Make in-battle orders/leadership
interactive via event cards drawn/played during a battle. Examples: troops out foraging are
absent at battle start but can *arrive mid-battle* from an event card; rally cards; stronger
cards gated on a leader being present. Ties into the character system; also a natural consumer
of the engine's mid-battle-reinforcement support (the replay recorder already handles units
appearing mid-battle).

**Units-as-data restructure (user design 2026-07-05, planned in `docs/UNITS_AS_DATA_PLAN.md`).**
Units become pure stat rows: all attacks delivered by the unit's weapon vector (melee
already works this way), spells from a requirement-gated roster (paths later), boolean
capability tags (flying) on AUnit, and finally a UnitSpec table replacing the subclass
zoo. Staged R0–R4 in that doc; first candidate for a post-playtest engine session.

**Restructuring candidates (assessed 2026-07-05; none scheduled — all post-playtest).**
1. *Split `Battlefield.cpp` by tick phase* — movement / engagements / combat into separate
   translation units with `Battlefield` staying the owner/coordinator. Mechanical and fully
   pinned by the engine suite + `make clang`; do it BEFORE the DESIGN.md frontage/formation
   system lands there, since that work will otherwise bloat one already-large file.
2. *Retire the `Utility::getBattlefield()` process-global* (pass `Battlefield&`/context
   explicitly; same for the RNG queue). This global is why tests shard across processes
   instead of threads and why a process can only ever host one battle. Sizeable, engine-wide —
   schedule it together with the engine-backed-skirmish follow-up, which is exactly the
   feature that wants many cheap in-process mini-battles.
3. *`capabilities.js` consolidation* (forage/screen/recon values → one mobile-arm + one
   combat-screen value) — already part of Stage 4 Phase C, no separate action.
Design steer as the roster grows: prefer stat/tag-driven unit variation (the `reconTag`
pattern) over new subclasses; the catalog+tripwire SSOT is the thing to preserve, not the
class count.

## Follow-ups (out of scope now)
Engine-backed skirmishes via `battleRunner` on a small map (`max_turns: 30`, watchable replays); tutorial content pass; `Militia` unit; fortification combat effects; region map; wood/metal split; flying scout/forager unit; enemy harass duty; character system; **enemy reinforcement schedule + its scouting detection** (prerequisite for the Stage 4 "reinforcement detection" mini-stage); richer event system (prerequisites/chains — distinct from Stage 4's event *transforms*).

## Independent assessment: weapons in C++ vs DB
**Keep weapons as C++ `constexpr` source of truth — do not move to DB.** Unit ctors reference weapons by identity (`addWeapon(MeleeWeapons::Pike)`); the engine is a self-contained stdin/stdout subprocess, and the DB is *populated from* the engine — a DB-sourced weapon table would invert that into a cycle and complicate the trust boundary. SSOT is about direction, not location: nothing downstream duplicates weapon data today, so there is no drift risk. Worthwhile later & cheap: extend `dump-units` to export each unit's weapon list read off a live instance (name, reach, shield, pen) for UI tooltips, optionally a `weaponCatalog()` + tripwire mirroring the unit pattern, synced to a display-only collection. No engine behaviour change.

## Verification (overall)
Per stage as listed. Cross-stage: WSL `make test` (engine tripwire + movement tests), `campaign-server npm test`, `frontend npm test`, then a full manual campaign: create → forage → scout reveal → battle → end-day with lying augur → materials spend → repeat until a ring runs dry.
